Oscillatory Doubly Diffusive Convection in a Finite Container,"Oscillatory doubly diffusive convection in a large aspect ratio Hele-Shaw cell is considered. The partial differential equations are reduced via center-unstable manifold reduction to the normal form equations describing the interaction of even and odd parity standing waves near onset. These equations take the form of the equations for a Hopf bifurcation with approximate D4 symmetry, verifying the conclusions of the preceding paper [A.S. Landsberg and E. Knobloch, Phys. Rev. E53, 3579 (1996)]. In particular, the amplitude equations differ in the limit of large aspect ratios from the usual Ginzburg-Landau description in having additional nonlinear terms with O(1) coefficients. Numerical simulations of the amplitude equations for experimental parameter values are presented and compared with the results of recent experiments by Predtechensky et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 218 (1994); Phys. Fluids 6, 3923 (1994)].",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/551,,,,,,,,,,,

Cross-sectional Structure of the Central Spindle of Diatoma vulgare  Evidence for Specific Interactions between Antiparallel Microtubules,"During the transition from prometaphase to metaphase, the cross-sectional area of the central spindle of Diatoma decreases by a factor of nearly two, both at the poles and at the region of overlapping microtubules (MTs) near the spindle equator. The density of spindle MT packing stays approximately constant throughout mitosis. Optical diffraction analysis of electron micrographs shows that the packing of the MTs at the poles at all stages of mitosis is similar to that expected for a two-dimensional liquid. Analysis of the region of overlap reveals more packing regularity: during prometaphase, a square packing emerges that displays sufficient organization by late metaphase to generate five orders of diffraction; during anaphase the packing in the overlap region shifts to hexagonal; at telophase, it returns to square. From the data provided by serial section reconstructions of the central spindle, it is possible to identify the polarity of almost every spindle MT, that is, to identify one pole with which the MT is associated. Near neighbor analyses of MTs in cross sections of the overlap region show that MTs prefer antiparallel near neighbors. These near neighbors are most often found at a spacing of approximately 40 nm center-to-center, while parallel near neighbors in the zone of overlap are spaced essentially at random. These results are evidence for a specific interaction between antiparallel MTs. In some sections definite bridges between MTs can be seen. Our findings show that certain necessary conditions for a sliding filament model of anaphase spindle elongation are met.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/independent_facpubs/29,,,,,,,,,,,

Three-dimensional Structure of the Central Mitotic Spindle of Diatoma vulgare,"Central mitotic spindles in Diatoma vulgare have been investigated using serial sections and electron microscopy. Spindles at both early stages (before metaphase) and later stages of mitosis (metaphase to telophase) have been analyzed. We have used computer graphics technology to facilitate the analysis and to produce stereo images of the central spindle reconstructed in three dimensions. We find that at prometaphase, when the nuclear envelope is dissassembling, the spindle is constructed from two sets of polar microtubules (MTs) that interdigitate to form a zone of overlap. As the chromosomes become organized into the metaphase configuration, the polar MTs, the spindle, and the zone of overlap all elongate, while the number of MTs in the central spindle decreases from greater than 700 to approximately 250. Most of the tubules lost are short ones that reside near the spindle poles. The previously described decrease in the length of the zone of overlap during anaphase central spindle elongation is clearly demonstrated in stereo images. In addition, we have used our three-dimensional data to determine the lengths of the spindle MTs at various times during mitotis. The distribution of lengths is bimodal during prometaphase, but the short tubules disappear and the long tubules elongate as mitosis proceeds. The distributions of MT lengths are compared to the length distributions of MTs polymerized in vitro, and a model is presented to account for our findings about both MT length changes and microtubule movements.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/independent_facpubs/30,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax Structures and FDI: The Deterrent Effects of Tax Complexity and Uncertainty,"This paper measures the distortionary and distributional effects of housing subsidies in the Netherlands. Its broad scope allows us to discuss the results in the light of the main justifications for subsidising housing, i.e. the merit–good argument, external effects and the distribution motive. Our measurements reveal some patterns of subsidisation that seem difficult to justify on these grounds. This applies especially to the differences between subsidisation of rental and owneroccupied housing and between mortgage– and equity–financed ownership. Moreover, the inelastic supply of housing in the Netherlands entails that subsidisation has only a limited effect on promoting housing quality.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/economics_facpubs/156,,,,,,,,,,,

The Effect of Loss Experiences in a Banking Crisis on Future Expectations and Behavior,Surveys taken in Bulgaria in both 2008 and 2009 show that people who had experienced a loss during an earlier banking crisis are significantly more likely to expect a new crisis. This result holds despite more than a decade between the earlier crisis and the surveys as well as the dramatically improved performance and stability of both the financial sector and the economy in the meantime. The loss experience also affects behavior. People who experienced a loss in the earlier crisis were more likely to have withdrawn funds from bank deposits in the midst of the international banking crisis in 2009.,https://scholarship.haverford.edu/economics_facpubs/153,,,,,,,,,,,

Bank Profitablity Performance in EU: Cross-country analysis,"This paper examines cross-country differences in selected aspects of bank profitability performance in the European Union in 2009. A key finding is that the overall pattern is heavily influenced by the outcomes in the three Baltic States and Ireland. If these countries are excluded from the sample, there is no evidence of a statistically significant relationship between the changes in return on equity and GDP growth and the extent of loan quality deterioration and increase in impairment charges in different countries. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/economics_facpubs/23,,,,,,,,,,,

"The importance of being confident; gender, career choice, and willingness to compete","This study investigates the extent to which gender differences in choosing to enter competitive tournaments are due to women's lower taste for competition or differences in confidence. We examine three types of confidence and find that confidence measured by expected ranking is the most important determinant of decisions to enter tournaments. Conditional on ability, this measure eliminates gender differences in winner-take-all tournaments and, when entered with risk measures, eliminates differences in ranked compensation tournaments. When the sample is split by career choice, there are no gender differences for students in STEM fields, and in the humanities and the social sciences differences can be explained by confidence. However, for business school students, gender differences in willingness to compete in winner-take-all tournaments persist even after accounting for risk aversion and confidence. Men in business set themselves apart from the rest of the population (men and women alike) with the highest levels of tournament entry and the most positive performance responses to competition.

Gender and Social Preferences in the U.S.: An Experimental Study,"This contribution provides evidence that social preferences differ by gender among United States college students. Tracking within-person choices over ten dictator exercises in which individuals choose one of three allocations of money between themselves and two other participants, this study precisely maps social preference types and identifies consistency of preferences within groups of roughly two-thirds of participants. Contrary to previous studies that identify a dominant social preference, this study's rigorous identification system reveals that other-regarding individuals are heterogeneous and almost evenly split between inequity aversion and social surplus maximization. But, even among individuals raised in a culture that stresses equal opportunity, there are gender differences. Women are substantially more likely than men to be inequity averters and less likely to be social surplus maximizers. However, a large majority of participants, both men and women, choose allocations consistent with compassion for the least well off. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/economics_facpubs/123,,,,,,,,,,,

Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research: A Protocol for Documenting Data Management and Analysis,"This article describes a protocol the authors developed for teaching undergraduates to document their statistical analyses for empirical research projects so that their results are completely reproducible and verifiable. The protocol is guided by the principle that the documentation prepared to accompany an empirical research project should be sufficient to allow an independent researcher to replicate easily and exactly every step of the data management and analysis that generated the results reported in a study. The authors hope that requiring students to follow this protocol will not only teach them how to document their research appropriately, but also instill in them the belief that such documentation is an important professional responsibility. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/economics_facpubs/14,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Role of Firm Size and Firm Age in Employment Growth: Evidence for Slovenia, 1996-2013","Using a nonparametric regression approach, this paper examines the role of firm size and firm age in net employment growth and the differential response of firms to the business cycle. An inverse univariate relationship between firm size and net employment growth disappears after controlling for firm age. With age control, the relationship between net employment growth and firm size is positive but diminishes with firm size. Young firms exhibit higher job creation and destruction rates and higher net employment growth rates than mature firms. Small and young firms are more sensitive with regard to net employment growth to the cyclical downturn than large and old firms.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/economics_facpubs/180,,,,,,,,,,,

"God and the Problem of Order: The Role of Perfect Information and Absolute Power in Economics, Religion and Law","The “problem of order” is resolved idyllically in Arrow-Debreu general-equilibrium modelsthrough the assumption of perfect information, where each actor is god-like, omniscient, andwhere this omniscience results in the veracity of the first theorem of welfare economics,where an equilibrium is Pareto efficient, where no actor, given her original endowments ofalienable and inalienable capital, can improve her position. Analogously, in many religions,God is understood to be omniscient; order emerges through God’s ability to sanctionmalfeasance costlessly. Ideally, a comparable order would likewise be the consequence of theassumption in both economics and religion of an omnipotent principal. In both economics andreligion, equilibria serve as idealized, transcendent, critical standards. In the real, immanent,world, where information is imperfect and no power is absolute, the institutionalization of lawis necessary to maintain order. Religion has bequeathed to the legal order moral principlesthat may legitimate the law and make it binding, while economics, as a theory of incentives inthe immanent world, models the imposition of legal sanctions, which penalize actors whoapproach and violate the law strategically. The law is an institutional order, where bothconstitutive norms and legal rules are legitimated through “religious” values and supported by“economic,” situational sanctions.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/sociology_facpubs/80,,,,,,,,,,,

"Fighting for Recognition: Identity, Masculinity, and the Act of Violence in Professional Wrestling","In Fighting for Recognition, R. Tyson Smith enters the world of independent professional wrestling, a community-based entertainment staged in community centers, high school gyms, and other modest venues. Like the big-name, televised pro wrestlers who originally inspired them, indie wrestlers engage in choreographed fights in character. Smith details the experiences, meanings, and motivations of the young men who wrestle as ""Lethal"" or ""Southern Bad Boy,"" despite receiving little to no pay and risking the possibility of serious and sometimes permanent injury. Exploring intertwined issues of gender, class, violence, and the body, he sheds new light on the changing sources of identity in a postindustrial society that increasingly features low wages, insecure employment, and fragmented social support. Smith uncovers the tensions between strength and vulnerability, pain and solidarity, and homophobia and homoeroticism that play out both backstage and in the ring as the wrestlers seek recognition from fellow performers and devoted fans.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/sociology_facpubs/59,,,,,,,,,,,

Performing civility : international competitions in classical music,"Although competitions in classical music have a long history, the number of contests has risen dramatically since the Second World War, all of them aiming to launch young artists' careers. This is not the symptom of marketization that it might appear to be. Despite the establishment of an international governing body, competitions are plagued by rumors of corruption, and even the most mathematically sophisticated voting system cannot quell accusations that the best talent is overlooked. Why do musicians take part? Why do audiences care so much about who wins? Performing Civility is the first book to address these questions. In this groundbreaking study, Lisa McCormick draws from firsthand observations of contests in Europe and the US, in-depth interviews with competitors, jurors and directors, as well as blog data from competition observers to argue that competitions have endured because they are not only about music, they are also about civility.     The first academic study to examine classical music competitions from a sociological perspective Provides a unified history of the emergence of classical music competitions, including a previously unpublished record of historical membership in the World Federation of International Music Competitions (WFIMC) Based upon firsthand observations, as well as interviews and conversations with participants about sharing their personal experiences and opinions   ",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/sociology_facpubs/85,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to critics who claim that the music in Die Zweite Heimat functions merely as a 'quid pro quo' for Reitz's film aesthetic, I intend to illustrate the highly independent role of music, which does not simply coincide with the medium of film but occupies a distinct position within the decade's sociopolitical landscape --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/german_facpubs/39,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Crisis of an Old Order: Gender, Sexual Relations, and Reproduction in Lessing's The Cleft","This article addresses Doris Lessing's depiction of gender, sexual relations, and reproduction in her controversial book The Cleft (2007). The novel challenges its readers to empathize heteropathically - as Kaja Silverman defines the term - across gender, outside of time, place, and outside the corporeal parameters of self (25-37). While Lessing's novel clearly speaks to issues of gender, it also complicates the notion of history and points to the paradox that the story of human history is primarily a male-dominated discourse. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/german_facpubs/22,,,,,,,,,,,

Achieving scalable locality with time skewing,"In this paper, I first define scalable locality,"" a property of programs that indicates that we can use microprocessors whose speed exceeds that of their memory systems by an arbitrarily large factor. (This is somewhat analogous to the parallel computing concept of ""scalable parallelism,"" which describes a property allowing the use of arbitrarily large numbers of microprocessors working together.) I then investigate the problem of producing scalable locality in certain scientific simulation programs. I demonstrate that this may require the rewriting of the program at the level of the ""time step"" loop--a level at which many existing automatic program transformation systems cannot operate. Finally, I describe a new automatic program transformation, which I call ""Time Skewing,"" and give experimental results showing its value for several applications and for several relative processor/memory speeds."" --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/compsci_facpubs/51,,,,,,,,,,,

A Term Logic for Physically Realizable Models of Information,"A paper in two parts.  The first part establishes a mathematical model of information based on uniform arrangements of matter in space.  These so-called singulary structures correspond to material representations of symbolic patterns, determined by the physical requirements of storing arbitrarily large amounts of data in a memory of unbounded size.  The second part introduces a functionally based term logic using numerical threshold quantifiers without variables.  Our main result shows that this classically motivated singulary logic has the same expressive power as ordinary first-order logic within this context.  It can be seen as contributing to the logical foundations of information. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/compsci_facpubs/18,,,,,,,,,,,

A Partisan National Song: The Politics of “Hail Columbia” Reconsidered,"Oscar Sonneck’s century-old definition of “Hail Columbia” as a non-partisan song needs revision. The song’s words and music, its promotion and reception in the Philadelphia newspapers, and the paratextual practices of representation associated with its early printed editions combine to situate “Hail Columbia” as part of an informal cultural program whereby Federalists leveraged the events of the Quasi-War and XYZ Affair to rouse support for Adams and discredit French-sympathizing Republicans. Whereas historians have heralded “Hail Columbia” as a spontaneous expression of an embryonic national spirit, and thus as transcending the partisan rancor of its day, the song ought to be studied as belonging to an effort to represent Federalist interests as the interests of the nation.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/music_facpubs/216,,,,,,,,,,,

"Provincial Anthropology, Circumlocution, and the Copious Use of Everything","Provincial towns are not miniature replicas of national metropolises but centers with their own trajectories of aesthetic and civic development. They operate in a regional context in relation both to the rural villages within their spheres of influence and to international cultural circuits. Inhabitants of peripheral towns in Greece negotiate the challenges of pluralism, modernization, and the hegemony of the nation state in their own social, political, and cultural idioms of accommodation and distancing. A close analysis of the modern history, city planning, and architecture of Florina in Western Greek Macedonia, particularly in the period between WWI and WWII, shows the development of an eclectic stylistic lingua franca in the aftermath of the appropriation of Muslim property and the demolition and suppression of the Muslim architectural presence. Provincial border towns manage their changing modes of heterogeneity in the context of an intimate space-in-common that generates an ambiguous pluralist semiotics in architecture as in dance.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/anthropology_facpubs/271,,,,,,,,,,,

Vistas [CD],"Ingrid Arauco's compositions are featured on two recently released CDs. VISTAS was released by Albany Records on November 1. Ingrid explains the concept behind the disc as follows: ""The word vistas conjures up a panorama of vivid images; however, it also signifies a broad perspective encompassing many experiences over time. The works on this album, written over a thirteen-year period, comprise a series of strong musical images embracing a variety of styles. Yet together they project a unified artistic vision, which I hope is also engaging and compelling."" The program includes Three for Two for clarinet and cello, Vistas for flute and piano, Trio for clarinet, viola, and piano, String Quartet No. 2, Divertimento for trumpet, violin, and cello, and Violiloquy for solo viola. Several of these pieces were commissions for organizations such as the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society, the Delaware Chamber Music Festival, and Network for New Music. The disc features an outstanding array of Performers, including Charles Abramovic, Paul Demers, Frank Ferraro, Barbara Govatos, Yumi Kendall, Jeffrey Khaner, John Koen, Ricardo Morales, Hirono Oka, and Burchard Tang. VISTAS is Ingrid's second solo album on the Albany label; her previous disc INVOCATION was released in 2011.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/music_facpubs/159,,,,,,,,,,,

Zilpha Keatley Snyder’s The Truth About Stone Hollow and the Genre of Time-Slip Fantasy,"Zilpha Keatley Snyder’s 1974 novel The Truth About Stone Hollow is situated at the crossroads of historical fiction and fantasy, and uses the genre of time-slip to explore how the past impacts the United States’ shifting national identity, and its protagonist’s coming-of-age. The heroine’s magical, frightening contact with the past demonstrates the incompleteness of memory, and its effect on the formation of identity. Her reckoning with the wrongs of the past, both familial and national, provides her with historical knowledge that is fluid and unstable, but also profoundly rooted in place, family, and nation",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/anthropology_facpubs/285,,,,,,,,,,,
‘They’re Closin’ Up Girl Land’: Female Masculinities in Children’s Fantasy,"This essay examines gender confusion or the testing of gender rules and roles which exist in fantasy fiction geared towards children. The novels discussed in the essay demonstrate “the constructedness of gender,” and seem to suggest that because anyone can be masculine (including girls and women), men shouldn’t be thought of as better than women, at least in the realm of masculinity. Of course, if fantasy rewards those who constantly strive to be masculine, thus keeping a good amount of “distance from femininity” (as if there is something wrong with being feminine), it would be safe to say that “masculine tyranny” would ensue, as well as sexist ideas.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/anthropology_facpubs/286,,,,,,,,,,,

ompVerify: Polyhedral Analysis for the OpenMP Programmer,"This chapter is the paper we presented at the 2011 international workshop on OpenMP. Many computational scientists choose to use their own programming skills to manage the distribution of work among computer processors, rather than trust this task to an automated system that is the typical and product of the mathematics and software (known as the polyhedral framework"") that has been produced by my research community. In this work, my co-authors and I show that this same mathematics and software can be used to help programmers catch mistakes in their hand-written software for work distribution.

Approximation Algorithm for the Kinetic Robust k-center Problem,"We introduce a framework for storing and processing kinetic data observed by sensor networks. These sensor networks generate vast quantities of data, which motivates a significant need for data compression. We are given a set of sensors, each of which continuously monitors some region of space. We are interested in the kinetic data generated by a finite set of objects moving through space, as observed by these sensors. Our model relies purely on sensor observations; it allows points to move freely and requires no advance notification of motion plans. Sensor streams are represented as random processes, where nearby sensors may be statistically dependent. We model the local nature of sensor networks by assuming that two sensor streams are statistically dependent only if the two sensors are among the m nearest neighbors of each other.  We present an algorithm for the lossless compression of the data produced by the network. We show that, under the statistical dependence and locality assumptions of our framework, asymptotically this compression algorithm encodes the data to within a constant factor of the information-theoretic lower bound dictated by the joint entropy of the system. In order to justify our locality assumptions, we provide a theoretical comparison with a variant of the kinetic data structures framework and experimental results demonstrating the existence of such locality properties in real-world data. We also give a relaxed version of our sensor stream independence property where even distant sensor streams are allowed some limited dependence. We extend the current understanding of empirical entropy to introduce definitions for joint empirical entropy, conditional empirical entropy, and empirical independence. We show that, even with the notion of limited independence and in both the statistical and empirical settings, the introduced compression algorithm achieves an encoding size that is within a constant factor of the optimal.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/compsci_facpubs/60,,,,,,,,,,,

Moderation and Mediation of an Effective HIV Risk-Reduction Intervention for South African Adolescents,"Let Us Protect Our Future"" is a sexual risk-reduction intervention for sixth-grade adolescents in South Africa. Tested in a cluster-randomized controlled trial, the intervention significantly reduced self-reported intercourse and unprotected intercourse during a 12-month follow-up period. The present analyses were conducted to identify moderators of the intervention's efficacy as well as, which theory-based variables mediated the intervention's effects. Intervention efficacy over the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up was tested using generalized estimating equation models. Living with their father in the home, parental strictness, and religiosity moderated the efficacy of the intervention in reducing unprotected intercourse. Self-efficacy to avoid risky situations and expected parental disapproval of their having intercourse, derived from Social Cognitive Theory, significantly mediated the intervention's effect on abstinence. This is the first study to demonstrate that Social Cognitive variables mediate the efficacy of a sexual risk-reduction intervention among South African adolescents."" --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/anthropology_facpubs/227,,,,,,,,,,,

Placing Students in Writing Classes: One University’s Experience with a Modified Version of DSP,"This article discusses our university’s attempt to analyze whether our system of First Year Writing placement serves the needs of our diverse student body. The theory behind Directed Self Placement (DSP) is appealing, so our program adopted a modified version of it, and after several years, decided to evaluate it quantitatively. The authors, a First Year Writing professor and a psychologist trained in statistical analysis, teamed up to gather and analyze data. We sorted our sample by course grade, standardized test scores, gender, race, and prior course grades, running regressions and searching for correlations between these data and our DSP matrix. Our research shows that DSP in the modified form of our placement matrix does not predict student success as measured by First Year Writing grades as well as simple standardized test scores do. Though placing students using test scores alone has limitations, we conclude that DSP, at least in the simplified form in which we use it, does not correct for these limitations, and therefore is not preferable.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/anthropology_facpubs/283,,,,,,,,,,,

"Steel Closets: Voices of Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Steelworkers","Even as substantial legal and social victories are being celebrated within the gay rights movement, much of working-class America still exists outside the current narratives of gay liberation. In Steel Closets, Anne Balay draws on oral history interviews with forty gay, lesbian, and transgender steelworkers, mostly living in northwestern Indiana, to give voice to this previously silent and invisible population. She presents powerful stories of the intersections of work, class, gender, and sexual identity in the dangerous industrial setting of the steel mill. The voices and stories captured by Balay--by turns alarming, heroic, funny, and devastating--challenge contemporary understandings of what it means to be queer and shed light on the incredible homophobia and violence faced by many: nearly all of Balay's narrators remain closeted at work, and many have experienced harassment, violence, or rape. Through the powerful voices of queer steelworkers themselves,Steel Closets provides rich insight into an understudied part of the LGBT population, contributing to a growing body of scholarship that aims to reveal and analyze a broader range of gay life in America.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/anthropology_facpubs/281,,,,,,,,,,,

Examining relationships between climate change and mental health in the Circumpolar North,"Indigenous people living in the Circumpolar North rely, to varying degrees, on the natural environment and the resources it provides for their lifestyle and livelihoods. As a consequence, these Northern Indigenous peoples may be more sensitive to global climate change, which has implications for food security, cultural practices, and health and well-being. To date, most research on the human dimensions of climate change in the Circumpolar North has focused on biophysical issues and their consequences, such as changing sea ice regimes affecting travel to hunting grounds or the effects of melting permafrost on built infrastructure. Less is known about how these changes in the environment affect mental health and well-being. In this paper, we build upon existing research, combined with our community-based research and professional mental health practices, to outline some pathways and mechanisms through which climate change may adversely impact mental health and well-being in the Circumpolar North. Our analysis indicates that mental health may be affected by climate change due to changes to land, ice, snow, weather, and sense of place; impacts to physical health; damage to infrastructure; indirect impacts via media, research, and policy; and through the compounding of existing stress and distress. We argue that climate change is likely an emerging mental health challenge for Circumpolar Indigenous populations and efforts to respond through research, policy, and mental health programming should be a priority. We conclude by identifying next steps in research, outlining points for policy, and calling for additional mental health resources that are locally responsive and culturally relevant.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/anthropology_facpubs/274,,,,,,,,,,,

Trickster Theatre,"Trickster Theatre traces the changing social significance of national theatre in Ghana from its rise as an idealistic state project from the time of independence to its reinvention in recent electronic, market-oriented genres. Jesse Weaver Shipley presents portraits of many key figures in Ghanaian theatre and examines how Akan trickster tales were adapted as the basis of a modern national theatre. This performance style tied Accra’s evolving urban identity to rural origins and to Pan-African liberation politics. Contradictions emerge, however, when the ideal Ghanaian citizen is a mythic hustler who stands at the crossroads between personal desires and collective obligations. Shipley examines the interplay between on-stage action and off-stage events to show how trickster theatre shapes an evolving urban world.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/anthropology_facpubs/279,,,,,,,,,,,
Mediation of effects of a theory-based behavioral intervention on self-reported physical activity in South African men,"Objective. Increasing physical activity is an important public-health goal worldwide, but there are few published mediation analyses of physical-activity interventions in low-to-middle-income countries like South Africa undergoing a health transition involving markedly increased mortality from non-communicable diseases. This article reports secondary analyses on the mediation of a theory-of-planned-behavior-based behavioral intervention that increased self-reported physical activity in a trial with 1181 men in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Method. Twenty-two matched-pairs of neighborhoods were randomly selected. Within pairs, neighborhoods were randomized to a health-promotion intervention or an attention-matched control intervention with baseline, immediate-post, and 6- and 12-month post-intervention assessments. Theory-of-planned-behavior constructs measured immediately post-intervention were tested as potential mediators of the primary outcome, self-reported physical activity averaged over the 6- and 12-month post-intervention assessments, using a product-of-coefficients approach in a generalized-estimating-equations framework. Data were collected in 2007-2010. Results. Attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy, and intention were significant mediators of intervention-induced increases in self-reported physical activity. The descriptive norm, not affected by the intervention, was not a mediator, but predicted increased self-reported physical activity. Conclusion. The results suggest that interventions targeting theory-of-planned-behavior constructs may contribute to efforts to increase physical activity to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases among South African men.

Treasures of the Athenaeum: 200 Years of Collecting,"From its inception in 1814, the Athenaeum’s founders were committed to collecting materials “connected with the history and antiquities of America, and the useful arts, and generally to disseminate useful knowledge.” The founders’ interest in useful arts and knowledge is clearly seen in the Treasures exhibition which showcases a diverse array of objects including furniture, sculpture, paintings, maps, drawings, photographs, silver and rare books. The items in the exhibition were selected by a group of distinguished guest curators comprised of C. Ford Peatress (Founding Director, Center for Architecture, Design and Engineering, the Library of Congress), Brock Jobe (Winterthur Museum), Alexandra Kirtley (Montgomery-Gavan Associate Curator of American Decorative Arts, Philadelphia Museum of Art), Andrew Lins (Neubauer Family Chair of Conservation, Philadelphia Museum of Art), Medill Higgins Harvey (Metropolitan Museum of Art), William Williams (Audrey A. and John L. Dusseau Professor in Humanities; Professor of Fine Arts and Curator of Photography, Haverford College), Samuel Streit (the John Hay Library, Brown University) and Daniel Traister (Annenberg Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Van Pelt, the University of Pennsylvania). In conjunction with the Treasures show, the guest curators will present a series of lectures and gallery talks through November on such topics as A.M. Calder’s maquette of Philadelphia City Hall’s William Penn statute, A.G. Quervelle’s pier table (ca. 1825-1830), Thomas U. Walter’s drawings of the United States Capitol, works of silver by Thomas Fletcher and Sidney Gardiner and select photographs and books. A complete schedule for the gallery talks and lectures can be found on the Athenaeum’s website at:www.PhilaAthenaeum.org.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/finearts_facpubs/228,,,,,,,,,,,

A unique and influential community of galleries, organizations, and institutions supported and nurtured photographers of the time and successfully brought awareness to the importance of collecting and further elevated the status of photography as fine art.These artists further contributed to the history of the medium by developing art programs and becoming professors at colleges and universities regionally and throughout the country.

"Infusing Theory into the Undergraduate Classics Curriculum: Examples from Haverford College's Senior Seminar, Translation and Transformation, and History of Literary Theory","This article describes three courses at Haverford College in which theory is the object of attention: Translation and Transformation: Theory and Practice; History of Literary Theory: Plato to Shelley; and Senior Seminar. In the last of these, students survey a range of theoretical approaches in relation to classical literature and are thus encouraged to develop senior theses that are more sophisticated in their awareness and use of method. The theoretical focus of all three courses allows students to appreciate the capacities and limitations of theory for the critical analysis of texts and cultures.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/classics_facpubs/111,,,,,,,,,,,

It focuses on allegorical novels that made the king, Louis XV, into a character and then mocked his authority. I argue that the techniques of fiction demystified the king in the eyes of the reading public and led them to judge him and demand accountability. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/history_facpubs/24,,,,,,,,,,,

Interactions between mood and left-right asymmetries in attention.,"This investigation examines interactions between mood and lateral asymmetries in visuospatial attention in normal human subjects. Dysphoric mood is proposed to be associated with decreased ability to shift attention in visual space, based upon prior evidence that the right parietal region is critical in this function, and evidence that functions of the right hemisphere are compromised in depressed mood states. Experiment 1 examines the effects of induced mood on responses to targets in the left (LVF) and right (RVF) visual fields in a standard valid/invalid cue paradigm. At brief cue-target delays, subjects who watched a sad film were slower to respond to LVF targets, compared to RVF targets, whereas subjects who watched a funny film showed no asymmetry. Experiment 2 examines the association between naturally-occurring variations in mood and attentional orienting ability. Subjects completed an orienting task and mood questionnaire on two separate occasions, and mood scores were used to identify one session as ""less dysphoric"" and the other as ""more dysphoric"". Results revealed an association between dysphoric mood and slowness in shifting attention away from the side of space compatible with the response hand. Experiment 3 examines whether manipulating subjects' attentional asymmetry affects subsequent mood state. One subject group completed a left-biased (LB) attentional task, with more targets occurring in the LVF, and another group completed a mirror image right-biased (RB) task. The LB group displayed greater declines in elation and vigor, and greater increases in fatigue, compared to the RB group. These results suggest that the LB task draws upon resources of right parietal regions that would otherwise be used to maintain arousal. Taken together, results of the three experiments support reciprocal interactions between mood state and lateral asymmetries in attention. However, the pattern of results is not consistent with a simple ""right hemisphere deficit"" hypothesis. Rather, dysphoric mood enhances attentional biases favoring the side of space compatible with the response hand. The neural basis of this aspect of attentional allocation is not clear, but may involve a combination of parietal, prefrontal, and interhemispheric mechanisms.

Neutral Hydrogen Observations of Interacting Galaxies: Arp 279 and Arp 263,"In this study we present atomic hydrogen (HI) observations and a preliminary analysis of the interacting galaxies Arp 279 (NGC 1253) and Arp 263 (NGC 3239). The data, obtained in March 1999 with the D-configuration of the Very Large Array (VLA), is part of a multiwavelength study of interacting galaxies and tidal dwarf formation. The observations reveal that the gas in each system is extended as far as ten galactic radii in Arp 263 and three galactic radii in Arp 279. The gas in the inner portions of the disks reveal differential rotation; the gas distribution in the outer parts, however, is perturbed. Extended tails are present in both systems indicating the presence of tidal disturbances. No tidally formed dwarf galaxies are found in these interactions. Arp 279 appears to be encountering an early stage interaction with a neighboring galaxy, Arp 279A. Arp 263, however, reveals signs of both early and late stage interactions. Higher resolution observations are needed to further investigate the properties of these interacting galaxies and do further kinematic analysis. The authors wish to thank the Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) for providing the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program under which this project took place (NSF grant AST-9423922).",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/383,,,,,,,,,,,

"Candidate RR Lyrae Stars Found in Sloan Digital  Survey Commissioning Data,","We present a sample of 148 candidate RR Lyrae stars selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning data for about 100 deg2 of sky surveyed twice with t = 1.9946 days. Although the faint-magnitude limit of the SDSS allows us to detect RR Lyrae stars to large Galactocentric distances (100 kpc, or r*  21), we find no candidates fainter than r*  20, i.e., farther than 65 kpc from the Galactic center. On the assumption that all 148 candidates are indeed RR Lyrae stars (contamination by other species of variable star is probably less than 10%), we find that their volume density has roughly a power-law dependence on Galactocentric radius, R-2.7±0.2, between 10 and 50 kpc and drops abruptly at R  5060 kpc, possibly indicating a sharp edge to the stellar halo as traced by RR Lyrae stars. The Galactic distribution of stars in this sample is very inhomogeneous and shows a clump of over 70 stars at about 45 kpc from the Galactic center. This clump is also detected in the distribution of nonvariable objects with RR Lyrae star colors. When sources in the clump are excluded, the best power-law fit becomes consistent with the R-3 distribution found from surveys of bright RR Lyrae stars. These results imply that the halo containsclumpy overdensities inhomogeneously distributed within a smooth R-3 background, with a possible cutoff at 50 kpc.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/359,,,,,,,,,,,

On What We Have in Common: The Universality of Philosophical Hermeneutics,This Summer 2004 issue of Renascence is entitled 'Critical Perspectives on Hans-Georg Gadamer.' My contribution takes up two types of misunderstandings of Gadamer's claim about the universality of hermeneutics. These correlate roughly to the way that Derrida and Habermas criticize Gadamer's hermeneutics. I propose a third way to understand the universality claim that Gadamer makes for hermeneutics. --author-supplied description,https://scholarship.haverford.edu/philosophy_facpubs/161,,,,,,,,,,,

A New Milky Way Companion: Unusual Globular Cluster or Extreme Dwarf Satellite?,"We report the discovery of SDSS J1049+5103, an overdensity of resolved blue stars at (α2000, δ2000) = (162343, 51051). This object appears to be an old, metal-poor stellar system at a distance of 45 ± 10 kpc, with a half-light radius of 23 ± 10 pc and an absolute magnitude of MV = -3.0. One star that is likely associated with this Milky Way companion has an SDSS spectrum confirming it as a blue horizontal-branch star at 48 kpc. The color-magnitude diagram of SDSS J1049+5103 contains few, if any, horizontal or red giant branch stars, similar to the anomalously faint globular cluster AM 4. The size and luminosity of SDSS J1049+5103 places it at the intersection of the size-luminosity relationships followed by known globular clusters and by Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. If SDSS J1049+5103 is a globular cluster, then its properties are consistent with the established trend that the largest radius Galactic globular clusters are all in the outer halo. However, the five known globular clusters with similarly faint absolute magnitudes all have half-mass radii that are smaller than SDSS J1049+5103 by a factor of 5. If it is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, then it is the faintest yet known by 2 orders of magnitude and is the first example of the ultrafaint dwarfs predicted by some theories. The uncertain nature of this new system underscores the sometimes ambiguous distinction between globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

Towards the Development of Peptide Nanfilaments and Nanoropes as Smart Materials,"Protein design studies using coiled coils have illustrated the potential of engineering simple peptides to self-associate into polymers and networks. Although basic aspects of self-assembly in protein systems have been demonstrated, it remains a major challenge to create materials whose large-scale structures are well determined from design of local protein–protein interactions. Here, we show the design and characterization of a helical peptide, which uses phased hydrophobic interactions to drive assembly into nanofilaments and fibrils (“nanoropes”). Using the hydrophobic effect to drive self-assembly circumvents problems of uncontrolled self-assembly seen in previous approaches that used electrostatics as a mode for self-assembly. The nanostructures designed here are characterized by biophysical methods including analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism to measure their solution properties, and atomic force microscopy to study their behavior on surfaces. Additionally, the assembly of such structures can be predictably regulated by using various environmental factors, such as pH, salt, other molecular crowding reagents, and specifically designed “capping” peptides. This ability to regulate self-assembly is a critical feature in creating smart peptide biomaterials.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/501,,,,,,,,,,,

Time-Series Ensemble Photometry and the Search for Variable Stars in the Open Cluster M11,"This work presents the first large-scale photometric variability survey of the intermediate-age (~200 Myr) open cluster M11. Thirteen nights of data over two observing seasons were analyzed (using crowded field and ensemble photometry techniques) to obtain high relative precision photometry. In this study we focus on the detection of candidate member variable stars for follow-up studies. A total of 39 variable stars were detected and can be categorized as follows: one irregular (probably pulsating) variable, six δ Scuti variables, 14 detached eclipsing binary systems, 17 W UMa variables, and one unidentified/candidate variable. While previous proper-motion studies allow for cluster membership determination for the brightest stars, we find that membership determination is significantly hampered below V=15, R=15.5 by the large population of field stars overlapping the cluster main sequence. Of the brightest detected variables that have a high likelihood of cluster membership, we find five systems in which further work could help constrain theoretical stellar models, including one potential W UMa member of this young cluster.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/381,,,,,,,,,,,

A Bright Millisecond Radio Burst of Extragalactic Origin,"Pulsar surveys offer a rare opportunity to monitor the radio sky for impulsive burst-like events with millisecond durations. We analyzed archival survey data and found a 30-jansky dispersed burst, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3° from the Small Magellanic Cloud. The burst properties argue against a physical association with our Galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. Current models for the free electron content in the universe imply that the burst is less than 1 gigaparsec distant. No further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations, which implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or coalescence of relativistic objects. Hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/382,,,,,,,,,,,

Deep Searches for Radio Pulsations and Bursts from Four Southern Anomalous X-ray Pulsars,"We have searched for persistent radio pulsations, bright single pulses, and bursts from four southern anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). Deep observations were conducted at 1.4 GHz in 1999 July and August with the Parkes 64 m telescope. For all of the target AXPs, the upper limits on integrated pulsed emission are ~0.02 mJy, while the limits on the flux of single pulses are ~1 Jy or better. The corresponding radio luminosity limits are significantly below the observed luminosities of the majority of the observed radio pulsars, and they are significantly below the radio luminosity of XTE J1810-197, the only AXP known thus far to emit radio pulsations, at the epoch when radio pulses were first detected from this source. Our null results support the hypothesis that pulsed radio emission from AXPs is only present in conjunction with X-ray outburst activity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that pulsed radio emission is present, but that it is too weak to be detected in our observations, or that unfavorable viewing geometries prevent this emission from being seen by terrestrial observers. Given the possible association between the radio emission and transient X-ray behavior of XTE J1810-197, continued radio searches of these and other AXPs at different epochs are warranted, particularly after periods of X-ray burst activity.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/394,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyarginine segments in block copolypeptides drive both vesicular assembly and intracellular delivery,"Polymeric vesicles are a relatively new class of nanoscale self-assembled materials that show great promise as robust encapsulants. Compared with liposomes, use of polymeric building blocks for membrane formation allows increased stability, stimuli responsiveness and chemical diversity, which may prove advantageous for drug-delivery applications . A major drawback of most polymeric vesicles is the lack of biofunctionality, which restricts their ability to interact with cells and tissues. We have prepared vesicles composed of polyarginine and polyleucine segments that are stable in media, can entrap water soluble species, and can be processed to different sizes and prepared in large quantities. The remarkable feature of these materials is that the polyarginine segments both direct structure for vesicle formation and provide functionality for efficient intracellular delivery of the vesicles. This unique synergy between nanoscale self-assembly and inherent peptide functionality provides a new approach for design of multifunctional materials for drug delivery.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/360,,,,,,,,,,,

The Star Formation Rate-Dense Gas Relation in the Nuclei of Nearby Galaxies,"We investigate the relationship between the star formation rate (SFR) and dense molecular gas mass in the nuclei of galaxies. To do this, we utilize the observed 850 μm luminosity as a proxy for the infrared luminosity (LIR) and SFR, and we correlate this with the observed CO(J = 3–2) luminosity. We find tentative evidence that the LIR-CO(J = 3–2) index is similar to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) index (N ≈ 1.5) in the central ~1.7 kpc of galaxies, and it flattens to a roughly linear index when including emission from the entire galaxy. This result may imply that the volumetric Schmidt relation is the underlying driver behind the observed SFR-dense gas correlations, and it provides tentative confirmation for recent numerical models.

Here, we assess the impact of these winds on the CO emission from galaxy mergers and, in particular, search for signatures of starburst and AGN-feedback-driven winds in the simulated CO morphologies and emission-line profiles. We do so by combining a three-dimensional non-LTE molecular line radiative transfer code with smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of galaxy mergers that include prescriptions for star formation, black hole growth, a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), and the winds associated with star formation and black hole growth. Our main results are (1) Galactic winds can drive outflows of masses ~108-109 M☉ which may be imaged via CO emission-line mapping. (2) AGN-feedback-driven winds are able to drive detectable CO outflows for longer periods of time than starburst-driven winds owing to the greater amount of energy imparted to the ISM by AGN feedback compared to star formation. (3) Galactic winds can control the spatial extent of the CO emission in postmerger galaxies, and may serve as a physical motivation for the subkiloparsec scale CO emission radii observed in local advanced mergers. (4) Secondary emission peaks at velocities greater than the circular velocity are seen in the CO emission lines in all models, regardless of the associated wind model. In models with winds, however, these high-velocity peaks are seen to preferentially correspond to outflowing gas entrained in winds, which is not the case in the model without winds. The high-velocity peaks seen in models without winds are typically confined to velocity offsets (from the systemic) 1.7 times the circular velocity, whereas the models with AGN-feedback-driven winds can drive high-velocity peaks to ~2.5 times the circular velocity.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/340,,,,,,,,,,,

Helium Separation Using Porous Graphene Membranes,"Graphene has been demonstrated to be impermeable to gases but can be made selectively permeable by introduction of pores. The permeability of a recently synthesized porous graphene structure to He, Ne, and CH4 is studied using MP2/cc-pVTZ potential energy surfaces. The role of quantum and classical transmission effects as a function of temperature are investigated. At room temperature, there is a 20 and 16% increase in transmission due to quantum tunneling for 3He and 4He, respectively, over the purely classical result. The large differences in classical barrier heights for transmission through this membrane (0.523, 1.245, and 4.832 eV for He, Ne, and CH4, respectively) allow for highly selective separation. This is proposed as an economical means of separating He from the other noble gases and alkanes present in natural gas. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/242,,,,,,,,,,,
Pain behavior in the formalin test persists after ablation of the great majority of C-fiber nociceptors,"Although the formalin test is a widely used model of persistent pain, the primary afferent fiber types that underlie the cellular and behavioral responses to formalin injection are largely unknown. Here we used a combined genetic and pharmacological approach to investigate the effect of ablating subsets of primary afferent nociceptors on formalin-induced nocifensive behaviors and spinal cord Fos protein expression. Intrathecal capsaicin-induced ablation of the central terminals of TRPV1+neurons greatly reduced the behavioral responses and Fos elicited by low-dose (0.5%) formalin. In contrast, genetic ablation of the MrgprD-expressing subset of non-peptidergic unmyelinated afferents, which constitute a largely non-overlapping population, altered neither the behavior nor the Fos induced by low-dose formalin. Remarkably, nocifensive behavior following high-dose (2%) formalin was unchanged in mice lacking either afferent population, or even in mice lacking both populations, which together make up the great majority of C-fiber nociceptors. Thus, at high doses, which are routinely used in the formalin test, formalin-induced ""pain"" behavior persists in the absence of the vast majority of C-fiber nociceptors, which points to a contribution of a large spectrum of afferents secondary to non-specific formalin-induced tissue and nerve damage.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/346,,,,,,,,,,,

"Theoretical Characterization of the Air-Stable, High-Mobility Dinaphtho[2,3-b:2'3'-f]thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene Organic Semiconductor","Recently, an optimum mobility of 8.3 cm(2)/(Vs) has been measured for single-crystal organic field-effect transistors based on the dinaphtho[2,3-b:2\',3\'-f]thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (DNTT) molecule. Here, on the basis of quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the microscopic charge transport parameters of the DNTT molecule and crystal. Our findings confirm that the moderate anisotropy of the hole mobility in DNTT is highly dependent on the presence of in-plane herringbonelike intermolecular interactions with large electronic coupling (transfer integral) values (ca. 0.1 eV). Also, we demonstrate that the T-extended heteroaromatic structure leads to strong electronic coupling interactions among neighboring molecules and to a decrease of the intramolecular reorganization energy. In DNTT, thermal modulations of the electronic Couplings at 300 K remain small when compared to those exhibited by the pentacene single crystal. This theoretical Study suggests that heteroacenes are a promising route toward high-mobility organic semiconductor materials. Charge transport is discussed in the framework of both band and hopping models. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/238,,,,,,,,,,,

The Vaccinia Virus Complement Control Protein Modulates Adaptive Immune Responses during Infection,"Complement activation is an important component of the innate immune response against viral infection and also shapes adaptive immune responses. Despite compelling evidence that complement activation enhances T cell and antibody (Ab) responses during viral infection, it is unknown whether inhibition of complement by pathogens alters these responses. Vaccinia virus (VACV) modulates complement activation by encoding a complement regulatory protein called the vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP). Although VCP has been described as a virulence factor, the mechanisms by which VCP enhances VACV pathogenesis have not been fully defined. Since complement is necessary for optimal adaptive immune responses to several viruses, we hypothesized that VCP contributes to pathogenesis by modulating anti-VACV T cell and Ab responses. In this study, we used an intradermal model of VACV infection to compare pathogenesis of wild-type virus (vv-VCPwt) and a virus lacking VCP (vv-VCPko). vv-VCPko formed smaller lesions in wild-type mice but not in complement-deficient mice. Attenuation of vv-VCPko correlated with increased accumulation of T cells at the site of infection, enhanced neutralizing antibody responses, and reduced viral titers. Importantly, depleting CD8(+) T cells together with CD4(+) T cells, which also eliminated T helper cell-dependent Ab responses, restored vv-VCPko to wild-type levels of virulence. These results suggest that VCP contributes to virulence by dampening both antibody and T cell responses. This work provides insight into how modulation of complement by poxviruses contributes to virulence and demonstrates that a pathogen-encoded complement regulatory protein can modulate adaptive immunity.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/498,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorinated and Nanoporous Graphene Materials As Sorbents for Gas Separations,"The physisorption of gases on surfaces depends on the electrostatic and dispersion interactions with adsorbates. The former can be tuned by introducing charge variations in the material, and the latter can be tuned by chemical substitution. Using atomistic Monte Carlo calculations, the Henry's law constants, and isosteric heats of adsorption of CH4, CO2, N2, O2, H2S, SO2, and H2O on graphene, two-dimensional polyphenylene (2D-PP), fluorographene, and fluoro(2D-PP) surfaces are used to demonstrate the tunability of these two types of interaction. With the exception of H2O, fluorination and nanoporosity-induced charge variations reduce the binding of the adsorbates. Gas separations relevant for CO2 sequestration, biogas upgrading, SO2 pollution control, and air dehumidification are considered, and in most cases, the nanoporosity and fluorination reduce the selectivity of adsorption. The exceptions are separations involving adsorption of H2O and the SO2/N2 separation, where the large dipole moments of the adsorbed species leads to enhanced binding relative to the nonpolar species. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/225,,,,,,,,,,,

Poxvirus Complement Control Proteins are Expressed on the Cell Surface through an Intermolecular Disulfide Bridge with the Viral A56 Protein,"The vaccinia virus (VACV) complement control protein (VCP) is an immunomodulatory protein that is both secreted from and expressed on the surface of infected cells. Surface expression of VCP occurs though an interaction with the viral transmembrane protein A56 and is dependent on a free N-terminal cysteine of VCP. Although A56 and VCP have been shown to interact in infected cells, the mechanism remains unclear. To investigate if A56 is sufficient for surface expression, we transiently expressed VCP and A56 in eukaryotic cell lines and found that they interact on the cell surface in the absence of other viral proteins. Since A56 contains three extracellular cysteines, we hypothesized that one of the cysteines may be unpaired and could therefore form a disulfide bridge with VCP. To test this, we generated a series of A56 mutants in which each cysteine was mutated to a serine, and we found that mutation of cysteine 162 abrogated VCP cell surface expression. We also tested the ability of other poxvirus complement control proteins to bind to VACV A56. While the smallpox homolog of VCP is able to bind VACV A56, the ectromelia virus (ECTV) VCP homolog is only able to bind the ECTV homolog of A56, indicating that these proteins may have coevolved. Surface expression of poxvirus complement control proteins may have important implications in viral pathogenesis, as a virus that does not express cell surface VCP is attenuated in vivo. This suggests that surface expression of VCP may contribute to poxvirus pathogenesis.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/497,,,,,,,,,,,
Oscillatory Flows Induced by Microorganisms Swimming in Two Dimensions,"We present the first time-resolved measurements of the oscillatory velocity field induced by swimming unicellular microorganisms. Confinement of the green alga C. reinhardtii in stabilized thin liquid films allows simultaneous tracking of cells and tracer particles.

The instantaneous mechanical power generated by the cells is measured from the velocity fields and peaks at 15 fW. The dissipation per cycle is more than 4 times what steady swimming would require.

"Narrating traumas and transgressions Links between narrative processing, wisdom, and well-being","In this study, we examined similarities and differences between narratives of two types of negative events, traumas and transgressions.  We examined both mean-level differences in qualities exhibited in the narratives (growth, complexity, resolution) and similarities/differences in how those narrative qualities relate to important outcomes related to personality, including wisdom and well-being. We found that traumas tend to be considered more important to the self than transgressions, though narratives did not differ in their levels of resolution, growth, or complexity.  Additionally, we found that attributing personal growth to transgression experiences was associated with higher levels of wisdom, whereas resolution in trauma narratives was associated with higher levels of well-being. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/130,,,,,,,,,,,

Equivariant Dierential Embeddings,"Takens [Dynamical Systems and Turbulence, Lecture Notes in Mathematics, edited by D. A. Rand and L. S. Young (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1981), Vol. 898, pp. 366–381] has shown that a dynamical system may be reconstructed from scalar data taken along some trajectory of the system. A reconstruction is considered successful if it produces a system diffeomorphic to the original. However, if the original dynamical system is symmetric, it is natural to search for reconstructions that preserve this symmetry. These generally do not exist. We demonstrate that a differential reconstruction of anynonlinear dynamical system preserves at most a twofold symmetry.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/334,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential Embedding of the Lorenz Attractor,"Ideally an embedding of an N-dimensional dynamical system is N-dimensional. Ideally, an embedding of a dynamical system with symmetry is symmetric. Ideally, the symmetry of the embedding is the same as the symmetry of the original system. This ideal often cannot be achieved. Differential embeddings of the Lorenz system, which possesses a twofold rotation symmetry, are not ideal. While the differential embedding technique happens to yield an embedding of the Lorenz attractor in three dimensions, it does not yield an embedding of the entire flow. An embedding of the flow requires at least four dimensions. The four dimensional embedding produces a flow restricted to a twisted three dimensional manifold in R4. This inversion symmetric three-manifold cannot be projected into any three dimensional Euclidean subspace without singularities.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/335,,,,,,,,,,,

A Biological Algorithm for Data Reconstruction,An algorithm inspired by Genome sequencing is proposed which “reconstructs” a single long trajectory of a dynamical system from many short trajectories. This procedure is useful in situations when many data sets are available but each is insufficiently long to apply a meaningful analysis directly. The algorithm is applied to the Rössler and Lorenz dynamical systems as well as to experimental data taken from the Belousov-Zhabotinskii chemical reaction. Topological information was reliably extracted from each system and geometrical and dynamical measures were computed.,https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/336,,,,,,,,,,,

The Role of Stereoactive Lone Pairs in Templated Vanadium Tellurite Charge Density Matching,"The role of charge density matching was investigated in the formation of templated vanadium tellurites under mild hydrothermal conditions. Reactions were conducted using a fixed NaVTeO5:amine ratio in an ethanol/water solution to isolate the effects of amine structure. The use of 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,3-diaminopropane, and piperazine resulted in three distinct vanadium tellurite connectivities, [V2Te2O10](n)(2n-) chains, [V2TeO8](n)(2n-) layers, and [V2Te2O10](n)(2n-) layers, respectively. Charge density matching with the protonated amines is the primary influence over the structure of each vanadium tellurite anion, as quantified by molecular surface area and geometric decomposition methods. Electron localization functions were calculated using the Stuttgart tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital, atomic sphere approximation code, to visualize the location and relative size, shape, and orientation of the stereoactive lone pair in the tellurite groups. [C4H14N2][V2Te2O10]: a = 5.649(5) angstrom, b = 6.348(5) angstrom, c = 9.661(5) angstrom, alpha = 84.860(5)degrees, beta = 85.380(5)degrees, gamma=81.285(5)degrees, triclinic, P (1) over bar (No. 2), Z=1. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/239,,,,,,,,,,,

The Luminosity and Mass Functions of Low-Mass Stars in the Galactic Disk. II. The Field,"We report on new measurements of the luminosity function (LF) and mass function (MF) of field low-mass dwarfs derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 photometry. The analysis incorporates ~15 million low-mass stars (0.1  ), spread over 8400 deg2. Stellar distances are estimated using new photometric parallax relations, constructed from ugriz photometry of nearby low-mass stars with trigonometric parallaxes. We use a technique that simultaneously measures Galactic structure and the stellar LF from 7 < Mr < 16. We compare the LF to previous studies and convert to an MF using the mass-luminosity relations of Delfosse et al. The system MF, measured over –1.0< log  <–0.1, is well described by a lognormal distribution with  = 0.25 . We stress that our results should not be extrapolated to other mass regimes. Our work generally agrees with prior low-mass stellar MFs and places strong constraints on future theoretical star formation studies.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/373,,,,,,,,,,,

The Effects of Mild Post-Stroke Exercise on Reactive Neurogenesis and Recovery of Somatosensation in Aged Rats,"Exercise impacts the cellular response and behavioral recovery following stroke, but has not been widely investigated in aged animals. We tested the hypothesis that gentle post-stroke exercise could enhance recovery of somatosensory function and influence survival and phenotype of newly generated cells in the peri-infarct region after focal cortical ischemia in aged rats. Focal stroke was induced in the forelimb area of the sensorimotor cortex in 18-month old male rats using the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1. Beginning 1 week after stroke or sham surgery, half of the animals walked 100-300 m daily, 5 days per week. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered on days 6-8 post-stroke in order to label proliferating cells, the survival and phenotype of which were examined 4 weeks later using confocal microscopy. Post-stroke exercise enhanced recovery of somatosensory function as measured by the Adhesive Removal Test. Stroke, but not exercise, increased the number of BrdU+ cells in the peri-infarct region. In aged rats, mild post-stroke exercise enhances recovery of somatosensation, but has little effect on survival and phenotype of cells born in response to ischemia. Our results underscore the need for further study of clinically relevant post-stroke exercise regimens.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/502,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular Disk Properties in Early Type Galaxies,"We study the simulated CO emission from elliptical galaxies formed in the mergers of gas-rich disk galaxies. The cold gas not consumed in the merger-driven starburst quickly resettles into a disk-like configuration. By analyzing a variety of arbitrary merger orbits that produce a range of fast- to slow-rotating remnants, we find that molecular disk formation is a fairly common consequence of gas-rich galaxy mergers. Hence, if a molecular disk is observed in an early-type merger remnant, it is likely the result of a ""wet merger"" rather than a ""dry merger."" We compare the physical properties from our simulated disks (e.g., size and mass) and find reasonably good agreement with recent observations. Finally, we discuss the detectability of these disks as an aid to future observations.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/333,,,,,,,,,,,

Geochemical Support for a Climbing Habit within the Paleozoic Seed Fern Genus Medullosa,"A long-standing problem in paleobotany is the accurate identification of the growth habits and statures of fossil plants. Tissue-specific analysis of stable carbon isotope ratios in plant fossils can provide an independent perspective on this issue. Lignin, a fundamental biopolymer providing structural support in plant tissues and the second most abundant organic material in plants, is ^(13)C depleted by several parts per thousand, averaging 4.1‰, relative to other plant constructional materials (e.g. cellulose). With this isotopic difference, the biochemical structural composition of ancient plants (and inferred stature) can be interrogated using microscale in situ isotope analysis between different tissues in fossils. We applied this technique to a well-preserved specimen of the Late Paleozoic seed plant Medullosa, an extinct genus with a variety of growth habits that includes several enigmatic yet abundant small-stemmed species widely found in calcium carbonate concretions (“coal balls”) in the Pennsylvanian coal beds of Iowa, USA. It remains unclear which of the medullosans were freestanding, and recent analysis of the medullosan vascular system has shown that this system provided little structural support to the whole plant. The leading hypothesis for small-stemmed medullosan specimens predicts that cortical tissues could have provided additional structural support, but only if they were lignified. The expected isotopic difference between lignified tissue and unlignified tissue is smaller than that expected from pure extracts, for the simple reason that even woody tissues maximally contain 40% lignin (by mass). This reduces the expected maximum difference between weakly and heavily lignified tissues by 60%, down to ~0.5‰–2‰. Analysis of the medullosan stem reveals a consistent difference in isotope ratios of 0.7‰–1.0‰ between lignified xylem and cortical tissues. This implies low abundances of lignin (between 0% and 11%) within the cortex. This inferred structural biochemistry supports hypotheses that the peripheral portions of these medullosan stems were not biomechanically reinforced to permit the plants to grow as freestanding, arborescent trees. A number of climbing or scandent medullosans have been identified in the fossil record, and this mode of growth has been suggested to be common within the group on the basis of observations from comparative biomechanics, hydraulics, and development. Finally, this mode of growth is common in several clades of stem group seed plants, including Lyginopteris and Callistophyton, along with Medullosa. This study provides further support for ideas that place a great portion of early seed plant diversity under the canopy, rather than forming it.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/482,,,,,,,,,,,

Threshold Tuning of the ATLAS Pixel Detector,"The threshold of each pixel in the Pixel Detector, measured in electrons (e), must be 7 properly set in order to optimize position resolution and particle detection efficiency. 8 This note details the threshold tuning performed for the full pixel detector over a 4- 9 month period in the fall of 2008. At the end of this period, 94% of the detector was 10 tuned to a measured mean threshold value of 3939 e, which is offset from the true 11 threshold value by ∼60 e, with an RMS of 37 e. The remaining 6% of the detector was 12 not measurable due to software or hardware problems.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/343,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mergers, Active Galactic Nuclei and Normal Galaxies: Contributions to the Distribution of Star  Formation Rates and Infrared Luminosity Functions","We use a novel method to predict the contribution of normal star-forming galaxies, merger-induced bursts and obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN), to infrared luminosity functions (LFs) and global star formation rate (SFR) densities. We use empirical halo occupation constraints to populate haloes with galaxies and determine the distribution of normal and merging galaxies. Each system can then be associated with high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. We predict the distribution of observed luminosities and SFRs, from different galaxy classes, as a function of redshift from z= 0 to 6. We provide fitting functions for the predicted LFs, quantify the uncertainties, and compare with observations. At all redshifts, ‘normal’ galaxies dominate the LF at moderate luminosities ∼L* (the ‘knee’). Merger-induced bursts increasingly dominate at L≫L*; at the most extreme luminosities, AGN are important. However, all populations increase in luminosity at higher redshifts, owing to increasing gas fractions. Thus, the ‘transition luminosity’ between normal and merger-dominated sources increases from the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG)–ultraluminous infrared galaxy threshold at z∼ 0 to bright Hyper-LIRG thresholds at z∼ 2. The transition to dominance by obscured AGN evolves similarly, at factor of several higher LIR. At all redshifts, non-merging systems dominate the total luminosity/SFR density, with merger-induced bursts constituting ∼5–10 per cent and AGN ∼1–5 per cent. Bursts contribute little to scatter in the SFR–stellar mass relation. In fact, many systems identified as ‘ongoing’ mergers will be forming stars in their ‘normal’ (non-burst) mode. Counting this as ‘merger-induced’ star formation leads to a stronger apparent redshift evolution in the contribution of mergers to the SFR density. We quantify how the evolution in LFs depends on evolution in galaxy gas fractions, merger rates, and possible evolution in the Schmidt–Kennicutt relation. We discuss areas where more detailed study, with full radiative transfer treatment of complex three-dimensional clumpy geometries in mixed AGN–star-forming systems, is necessary.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/352,,,,,,,,,,,

Synthesis and Crosslinking of L-DOPA Containing Polypeptide Vesicles,"The synthesis and self-assembly of DOPA containing diblock copolypeptides into spherical vesicles is described. DOPA residues are naturally abundant in mussel adhesive proteins and are responsible for extensive covalent crosslinking of these materials upon oxidation. We found that vesicles could be formed from copolypeptides containing different amounts of DOPA substituted into hydrophobic segments, up to 100% DOPA content. The DOPA containing vesicles were covalently crosslinked in water using an oxidizing agent, in a process similar to the crosslinking of mussel adhesive proteins, which gave vesicles with dramatically improved membrane stability against freeze-drying, organic solvent, osmotic stress and complex media. These materials showed greatly enhanced membrane stability compared to non-crosslinked vesicles and have the advantage that the biomimetic crosslinker DOPA can be incorporated directly into the polypeptide sequence during synthesis.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/359,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of Hydrogen-Bonding in the Formation of Polar Achiral and Nonpolar Chiral Vanadium Selenite Frameworks,"A series of organically templated vanadium selenites have been prepared under mild hydrothermal conditions. Single crystals were grown from mixtures of VOSO4, SeO2, and either 1,4-dimethylpiperazine, 2,5-dimethylpiperazine, or 2-methylpiperazine in H2O. Each compound contains one-dimensional [VO(SeO3)(HSeO3)](n)(n-), secondary building units, which connect to form three-dimensional frameworks in the presence of 2,5-dimethylpiperazine or 2-methylpiperazine. Differences in composition and both intra-secondary building unit and organic-inorganic hydrogen-bonding between compounds dictate the dimensionality of the resulting inorganic structures. [1,4-dimethylpiperazineH(2)] [VO(SeO3)(HSeO3)](2) contains one-dimensional [VO(SeO3)(HSeO3)](n)(n-) chains, while [2,5-dimethylpiperazineH(2)] [VO(SeO3)(HSeO3)](2)center dot 2H(2)O contains a three-dimensional [VO(SeO3)(HSeO3)](n)(n-) framework. The use of racemic 2-methylpiperazine also results in a compound containing a three-dimensional [VO(SeO3)(HSeO3)](n)(n-) framework, crystallizing in the noncentrosymmetric polar, achiral space group Pca2(1) (no. 29), while analogous reactions containing either (R)-2-methylpiperazine or (S)-2-methylpiperazine result in noncentrosymmetric, nonpolar chiral frameworks that crystallize in P2(1)2(1)2 (no. 18). The formation of these noncentrosymmetric framework materials is dictated by the structure, symmetry, and hydrogen-bonding properties of the [2-methylpiperazineH(2)](2+) cations. --auhtor-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/249,,,,,,,,,,,
Thermally-driven isotope separation across nanoporous graphene,"Quantum tunneling contributes to the transmission of atoms through nanoporous graphene barriers, even at room temperature. In a temperature gradient, the mass-dependence of tunneling leads to isotope separation, in contrast to the classical transmission case where no separation can occur. Using transition state theory, we show that zero-point and tunneling contributions enrich the isotopes in opposite directions with respect to the temperature gradient. Zero-point energy differences dominate around room temperature. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/227,,,,,,,,,,,

Carbon Dioxide Separation with a Two-Dimensional Polymer Membrane,"Carbon dioxide gas separation is important for many environmental and energy applications. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to characterize a two-dimensional hydrocarbon polymer, PG-ES1, that uses a combination of surface adsorption and narrow pores to separate carbon dioxide from nitrogen, oxygen, and methane gases. The CO2 permeance is 3 x 10(5) gas permeation units (GPU). The CO2/N-2 selectivity is 60, and the CO2/CH4 selectivity exceeds 500. The combination of high CO2 permeance and selectivity surpasses all known materials, enabling low-cost postcombustion CO2 capture; utilization of landfill gas, and horticulture applications. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/246,,,,,,,,,,,
Ethanol concentration by forward osmosis with solar-regenerated draw solution,"Production of fuel-grade ethanol requires removing excess water following fermentation, which is typically performed by an energy intensive distillation process. This paper proposes a simple, low-cost, and scalable alternative method of removing water using forward osmosis. The draw solution is an aqueous brine that is regenerated by solar evaporation. Separation limits of this approach are calculated using the van Laar equation for the non-ideality of the ethanol/water mixture, and experimentally measured activities for aqueous solutions of NaCl, CaCl2, K2HPO4, and K4P2O7. We focus on production of 95%, 50% and 30% (w/w) ethanol solutions as fuel for cooking stoves and homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines, both of which tolerate larger amounts of water in the product. Evaporation-limited production rates are computed using long-term meteorological data for sites in Ethiopia, Thailand, Brazil, and India. These calculations can be used to determine the size requirements necessary for a given daily production rate for any desired ethanol concentration. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/233,,,,,,,,,,,
The Globular Cluster Populations of Giant Galaxies: Mosaic Imaging of Five Moderate-Luminosity Early-Type Galaxies,"This paper presents results from wide-field imaging of the globular cluster (GC) systems of five intermediate-luminosity (MV ~ –21 to –22) early-type galaxies. The aim is to accurately quantify the global properties of the GC systems by measuring them out to large radii. We obtained BVR imaging of four lenticular galaxies (NGC 5866, NGC 4762, NGC 4754, NGC 3384) and one elliptical galaxy (NGC 5813) using the KPNO 4 m telescope and Mosaic imager and traced the GC population to projected galactocentric radii ranging from ~20 kpc to 120 kpc. We combine our imaging with Hubble Space Telescope data to measure the GC surface density close to the galaxy center. We calculate the total number of GCs (N GC) from the integrated radial profile and find N GC = 340 ± 80 for NGC 5866, N GC = 2900 ± 400 for NGC 5813, N GC = 270 ± 30 for NGC 4762, N GC = 115 ± 15 for NGC 4754, and N GC = 120 ± 30 for NGC 3384. The measured GC specific frequencies are SN between 0.6 and 3.6 and T in the range 0.9-4.2. These values are consistent with the mean specific frequencies for the galaxies' morphological types found by our survey and other published data. Three galaxies (NGC 5866, NGC 5813, and NGC 4762) had sufficient numbers of GC candidates to investigate color bimodality and color gradients in the GC systems. NGC 5813 shows strong evidence (>3σ) for bimodality and a B – R color gradient resulting from a more centrally concentrated red (metal-rich) GC subpopulation. We find no evidence for statistically significant color gradients in the other two galaxies.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/378,,,,,,,,,,,

Helium Tunneling through Nitrogen-Functionalized Graphene Pores: Pressure- and Temperature-Driven Approaches to Isotope Separation,"Recently, we showed that nitrogen-functionalized nanopores obtained by removing two rings from a perfect graphene sheet provide suitable barriers for a separation of fermionic helium-3 from its bosonic counterpart helium-4 [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2012, 3, 209-213]. In this follow-up Article, we provide potential curves for helium passing through several different types of pores, discuss the relation of the barrier height to the effective pore size, give estimations for bound states of helium attached to the pores, and analyze the effects of isomeric and stoichiometric variations of the pore-rim nitrogen-passivation on the gas separation performance. Slight deviations in the tunneling probability for the two helium isotopes can lead to a high selectivity at an industrially acceptable gas flux if the gas temperature is kept sufficiently low. We also recently showed that the mass-dependence of quantum tunneling and zero-point energy differences at the top of the potential energy barrier allow for a classically prohibited steady-state thermally driven isotope separation [Chem. Phys. Lett. 2012, 521, 118-124]. The nitrogen-passivated nanopores studied here give rise to larger steady-state isotopic enrichment than that in previous work and are dominated by zero-point energy differences at both high and low temperatures. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/245,,,,,,,,,,,

Multipartite quantum entanglement evolution in photosynthetic complexes,"We investigate the evolution of entanglement in the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex based on simulations using the scaled hierarchical equations of motion approach. We examine the role of entanglement in the FMO complex by direct computation of the convex roof. We use monogamy to give a lower bound for entanglement and obtain an upper bound from the evaluation of the convex roof. Examination of bipartite measures for all possible bipartitions provides a complete picture of the multipartite entanglement. Our results support the hypothesis that entanglement is maximum primary along the two distinct electronic energy transfer pathways. In addition, we note that the structure of multipartite entanglement is quite simple, suggesting that there are constraints on the mixed state entanglement beyond those due to monogamy.

Human Rights-Based Approaches to Development: Justice and Legal Fiction in Africa,"Human rights-based approaches (HRBAs) to development have led to the expansion of laws protecting women's rights. Nevertheless, most women still do not have access to justice. This article explores family law reform in ""Africa and argues that establishing African ownership of law contributes to the effectiveness and legitimacy of such laws. It argues for a mixed strategy that combines local and international tools to lead to more effective protection of women's rights. Regional alliances that led to the adoption of the Protocol to the African Charter for Human and People's Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa served to legitimize this Protocol over other international treaties. It also examines how paralegals are a bridge between local and international norms and, as such, they are an important mechanism for more effective HRBAs to development.

Hydrodynamic Irreversibility in Particle Suspensions with Nonuniform Strain,"A dynamical phase transition from reversible to irreversible behavior occurs when particle suspensions are subjected to uniform oscillatory shear, even in the Stokes flow limit. We consider a more general situation with nonuniform strain (e.g., oscillatory channel flow), which is observed to exhibit markedly different dynamics. The onset of irreversibility is delayed, and occurs simultaneously across the entire channel. This behavior is only partially explained by self-organization and shear-induced migration. The onset is accompanied by long-range correlated particle motion even at the channel center, where the strain is negligible; this motion prevents the system from evolving into a reversible state.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/338,,,,,,,,,,,

GSK3-mediated instability of tubulin polymers is responsible for the failure of immature CD4+CD8+thymocytes to polarize their MTOC in response to TCR stimulation,"This is not in as prestigious a journal as the first paper described, but it is in a fine one (International Immunology) - and describes work that comes from our undergraduate lab alone. The work began years ago (Emily Hinchcliff, the co-first author, is almost finished with her medical school education at Harvard) but needed to be refined. We are perhaps even happier about this publication which represents the work of several students over several years. It may not take the world by storm, but it does add some very clear and crisp novel information about the molecular basis for differences in mature and immature T cell function. These differences underlie both our ability to generate an immune response and to avoid abnormal (autoimmune) responses - and are still rather mysterious. Specifically, we show that a kinase (GSK3) is regulated differently in the two cell types and is responsible for a failure of the young cells to develop a mature response to signals (polarization of a cytoskeletal structure). This 'failure' is probably a good thing and keeps the young cells from reacting before they have learned to modulate themselves. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/409,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Global Postcolonial Moment and the American New Town: India, Reston, Dodoma","As with many of the 1960s new towns, scholars place Reston, Virginia, in the garden city tradition. This essay argues instead that Reston brought to the United States a unique midcentury architectural vernacular, born not in Britain but in the postcolonial world. The war effort spirited American architects abroad. Some stayed to advise governments building independent nations. One of them was the New Yorker Albert Mayer, along with members of his firm. Designing new cities in India, these Americans came into contact with Indian architects creating their own sense of a national built environment. Reston brought the form created by these encounters to the Washington suburbs. The essay highlights the links between the revised modernism of the International Congress of Modern Architecture (CIAM) in the 1950s and postcolonial building practices. Reston then became a pedagogical space, as international visitors circulated its representative forms abroad again, to India, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/history_facpubs/16,,,,,,,,,,,
Evolutionary Voyage of Angiosperm Vessel Structure-Function and its Significance for Early Angiosperm Success,"A hypothesized advantage of the building block of the angiosperm vascular network, the vessel, is often cited as a critical innovation that elevated the competitive abilities of early angiosperms above nonangiosperms during the Cretaceous. Here we synthesize recent discoveries on the hydraulic functions of living basal angiosperm lineages with evidence from the fossil record to trace the early evolutionary significance of vessels in the early ecophysiological radiation of angiosperms. Evidence from extant comparative biology and the Early Cretaceous fossil record of leaves and wood do not support the hypotheses that vessels improved drought tolerance of angiosperms, increased angiosperm's photosynthetic abilities, or provided an immediate leap in hydraulic capacity. Instead, later tuning of vessel structure for increased flow efficiency-in particular, by the evolution of simple perforation plates-enabled major increases in xylem hydraulic efficiency. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/460,,,,,,,,,,,

Two Millisecond Pulsars Discovered by the PALFA Survey and a Shapiro Delay Measurement,"We present two millisecond pulsar discoveries from the PALFA survey of the Galactic plane with the Arecibo telescope. PSR J1955+2527 is an isolated pulsar with a period of 4.87 ms, and PSR J1949+3106 has a period of 13.14 ms and is in a 1.9 day binary system with a massive companion. Their timing solutions, based on 4 years of timing measurements with the Arecibo, Green Bank, Nançay, and Jodrell Bank telescopes, allow precise determination of spin and astrometric parameters, including precise determinations of their proper motions. For PSR J1949+3106, we can clearly detect the Shapiro delay. From this we measure the pulsar mass to be 1.47+0.43 – 0.31 M ☉, the companion mass to be 0.85+0.14 – 0.11 M ☉, and the orbital inclination to be i = 79.9–1.9 + 1.6 deg, where uncertainties correspond to ±1σ confidence levels. With continued timing, we expect to also be able to detect the advance of periastron for the J1949+3106 system. This effect, combined with the Shapiro delay, will eventually provide very precise mass measurements for this system and a test of general relativity.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/375,,,,,,,,,,,

Four Highly Dispersed Millisecond Pulsars Discovered in the Arecibo PALFA Galactic Plane Survey,"We present the discovery and phase-coherent timing of four highly dispersed millisecond pulsars (MSPs) from the Arecibo PALFA Galactic plane survey: PSRs J1844+0115, J1850+0124, J1900+0308, and J1944+2236. Three of the four pulsars are in binary systems with low-mass companions, which are most likely white dwarfs, and which have orbital periods on the order of days. The fourth pulsar is isolated. All four pulsars have large dispersion measures (DM >100 pc cm–3), are distant ( 3.4 kpc), faint at 1.4 GHz ( 0.2 mJy), and are fully recycled (with spin periods P between 3.5 and 4.9 ms). The three binaries also have very small orbital eccentricities, as expected for tidally circularized, fully recycled systems with low-mass companions. These four pulsars have DM/P ratios that are among the highest values for field MSPs in the Galaxy. These discoveries bring the total number of confirmed MSPs from the PALFA survey to 15. The discovery of these MSPs illustrates the power of PALFA for finding weak, distant MSPs at low-Galactic latitudes. This is important for accurate estimates of the Galactic MSP population and for the number of MSPs that the Square Kilometer Array can be expected to detect.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/376,,,,,,,,,,,

Effect of charged residue side chain length on intrahelical glutamate-lysine ion pairing interactions,"Ion pairing interactions between oppositely charged amino acids are important for protein structure stability. Despite the apparent electrostatic nature of these interactions, the charged amino acids Lys, Arg, Glu, and Asp have a different number of hydrophobic methylenes linking the charged functionality to the backbone. To investigate the effect of Glu (and Asp) side chain length on ion pairing interactions, a series of 36 monomeric alpha-helical peptides containing Zbb-Xaa (i, i+3), (i, i+4), and (i, i+5) (Zbb = Aad, Glu, Asp; Xaa = Lys, Orn, Dab, Dap) sequence patterns were studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy at pH 7 and 2. Peptides with Glu and Aad exhibited similar helicity and pH dependence, whereas peptides with Asp behaved distinctly different. The side chain interaction energetics were derived from the CD data using the nesting block method coupled with modified Lifson-Roig theory. At pH 7, no Zbb-Xaa (i, i+5) interaction was observed, regardless of side chain length (consistent with the helix geometry). Interestingly, only Lys was capable of supporting Zbb-Xaa (i, i+3) interactions, whereas any Xaa side chain length supported Zbb-Xaa (i, i+4) interactions. In particular, the magnitude of both Zbb(-)-Lys (i, i+4) and Zbb(-)-Orn (i, i+4) interaction energies followed the trend Asp > Glu > Aad. Side chain conformational analysis by molecular mechanics calculations showed that the Zbb-Xaa (i, i+3) interactions involved the chi(1) dihedral combination (g+, g+) for the i and i+3 residues, whereas the Zbb-Xaa (i, i+4) interactions were supported by the chi(1) dihedral combination (t, g+) for the i and i+4 residues. These calculated low energy conformers were consistent with conformations of intrahelical Asp-Lys and Glu-Lys salt bridges in a nonredundant protein structure database. These results suggest that Asp and Glu provide natural variation, and lengthening the Glu side chain further to Aad does not Furnish additional characteristics that Glu cannot supply. --author-supplied description.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/477,,,,,,,,,,,

"Is ""conflict adaptation"" driven by conflict? Behavioral and EEG evidence for the underappreciated role of congruent trials","Theories of cognitive control argue that response conflict in speeded performance tasks leads to adaptive changes, such that irrelevant information is better ignored on subsequent trials. This study tested whether trial-by-trial changes are driven primarily by conflict on incongruent trials or instead by congruent trials, in which irrelevant and relevant stimulus dimensions match. In a Stroop task including congruent, incongruent, and neutral trials, interference was greater following congruent compared to incongruent and neutral trials, which did not differ. During the intertrial interval, EEG alpha power, an inverse measure of cerebral activation, was significantly lower following congruent than neutral trials, whereas incongruent and neutral trials did not differ. These results imply that trial-by-trial changes in performance may not be driven solely by conflict, but rather by changes in attention triggered by congruent information. -- author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/69,,,,,,,,,,,

Bounding Polynomial Entanglement Measures for Mixed States,"We generalize the notion of the best separable approximation (BSA) and best W-class approximation (BWA) to arbitrary pure-state entanglement measures, defining the best zero-E approximation (BEA). We show that for any polynomial entanglement measure E, any mixed state ρ admits at least one “S decomposition,” i.e., a decomposition in terms of a mixed state on which E is equal to zero, and a single additional pure state with (possibly) nonzero E. We show that the BEA is not, in general, the optimal S decomposition from the point of view of bounding the entanglement of ρ and describe an algorithm to construct the entanglement-minimizing S decomposition for ρ and place an upper bound on E(ρ). When applied to the three-tangle, the cost of the algorithm is linear in the rank d of the density matrix and has an accuracy comparable to a steepest-descent algorithm whose cost scales as d8 log d. We compare the upper bound to a lower-bound algorithm given by C. Eltschka and J. Siewert [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 020502 (2012)] for the three-tangle and find that on random rank-2 three-qubit density matrices, the difference between the upper and lower bounds is 0.14 on average. We also find that the three-tangle of random full-rank three-qubit density matrices is less than 0.023 on average.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/282,,,,,,,,,,,
Near-Infrared Detection of WD 0806-661 B with the Hubble Space Telescope,"WD 0806-661 B is one of the coldest known brown dwarfs (T eff = 300-345 K) based on previous mid-infrared photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition, it is a benchmark for testing theoretical models of brown dwarfs because its age and distance are well constrained via its primary star (2 ± 0.5 Gyr, 19.2 ± 0.6 pc). We present the first near-infrared detection of this object, which has been achieved through F110W imaging (~Y + J) with the Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We measure a Vega magnitude of m 110 = 25.70 ± 0.08, which implies J ~ 25.0. When combined with the Spitzerphotometry, our estimate of J helps to better define the empirical sequence of the coldest brown dwarfs in M 4.5 versus J – [4.5]. The positions of WD 0806-661 B and other Y dwarfs in that diagram are best matched by the cloudy models of Burrows et al. and the cloudless models of Saumon et al., both of which employ chemical equilibrium. The calculations by Morley et al. for 50% cloud coverage differ only modestly from the data. Spectroscopy would enable a more stringent test of the models, but based on our F110W measurement, such observations are currently possible only with Hubble, and would require at least ~10 orbits to reach a signal-to-noise ratio of ~5.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/362,,,,,,,,,,,

What happens when you can’t read the air? Cultural fit and aptitude by values interactions on social anxiety,"Poor ability to decode others' emotions has been linked with social anxiety; however, does this association differ according to the degree to which one values interconnectedness and emotional attunement? The authors propose an intrapersonal cultural fit hypothesis suggesting that the association between emotion recognition ability and social anxiety is moderated by the degree to which one holds an interdependent self-construal. In a sample of Asian American (AA) and European American (EA) college students, emotion recognition ability was assessed using laboratory task and self-report methods, and associations with self-reported social anxiety were examined. Results provide initial support for the hypothesized aptitude by values interaction, indicating that problems reading the air have greater costs for social anxiety among AAs who endorsed high collectivism.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/276,,,,,,,,,,,
The flight of the GAPS prototype experiment,"The General AntiParticle Spectrometer experiment (GAPS) is foreseen to carry out a dark matter search using low-energy cosmic ray antideuterons at stratospheric altitudes with a novel detection approach. A prototype flight from Taiki, Japan was carried out in June 2012 to prove the performance of the GAPS instrument subsystems (Lithium-drifted Silicon tracker and time-of-flight) and the thermal cooling concept as well as to measure background levels. The flight was a success and the stable flight operation of the GAPS detector concept was proven. During the flight about 106 charged particle triggers were recorded, extensive X-ray calibrations of the individual tracker modules were performed by using an onboard X-ray tube, and the background level of atmospheric and cosmic X-rays was measured. The behavior of the tracker performance as a function of temperature was investigated. The tracks of charged particle events were reconstructed and used to study the tracking resolution, the detection efficiency of the tracker, and coherent X-ray backgrounds. A timing calibration of the time-of-flight subsystem was performed to measure the particle velocity. The flux as a function of flight altitude and as a function of velocity was extracted taking into account systematic instrumental effects. The developed analysis techniques will form the basis for future flights.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/352,,,,,,,,,,,

Cold Molecular Gas in Merger Remnants. I. Formation of Molecular Gas Disks,"We present the 1 kpc resolution 12CO imaging study of 37 optically selected local merger remnants using new and archival interferometric maps obtained with ALMA, CARMA, the Submillimeter Array, and the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. We supplement a sub-sample with single-dish measurements obtained at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope for estimating the molecular gas mass (107 – 11 M ☉) and evaluating the missing flux of the interferometric measurements. Among the sources with robust CO detections, we find that 80% (24/30) of the sample show kinematical signatures of rotating molecular gas disks (including nuclear rings) in their velocity fields, and the sizes of these disks vary significantly from 1.1 kpc to 9.3 kpc. The size of the molecular gas disks in 54% of the sources is more compact than the K-band effective radius. These small gas disks may have formed from a past gas inflow that was triggered by a dynamical instability during a potential merging event. On the other hand, the rest (46%) of the sources have gas disks that are extended relative to the stellar component, possibly forming a late-type galaxy with a central stellar bulge. Our new compilation of observational data suggests that nuclear and extended molecular gas disks are common in the final stages of mergers. This finding is consistent with recent major-merger simulations of gas-rich progenitor disks. Finally, we suggest that some of the rotation-supported turbulent disks observed at high redshifts may result from galaxies that have experienced a recent major merger.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/360,,,,,,,,,,,

Arecibo Pulsar Survey Using ALFA. III. Precursor Survey and Population Synthesis,"The Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (PALFA) Survey uses the ALFA 7-beam receiver to search both inner and outer Galactic sectors visible from Arecibo (32° ℓ 77° and 168° ℓ 214°) close to the Galactic plane (|b| 5°) for pulsars. The PALFA survey is sensitive to sources fainter and more distant than have previously been seen because of Arecibo's unrivaled sensitivity. In this paper we detail a precursor survey of this region with PALFA, which observed a subset of the full region (slightly more restrictive in ℓ and |b| 1°) and detected 45 pulsars. Detections included 1 known millisecond pulsar and 11 previously unknown, long-period pulsars. In the surveyed part of the sky that overlaps with the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey (36° ℓ 50°), PALFA is probing deeper than the Parkes survey, with four discoveries in this region. For both Galactic millisecond and normal pulsar populations, we compare the survey's detections with simulations to model these populations and, in particular, to estimate the number of observable pulsars in the Galaxy. We place 95% confidence intervals of 82,000 to 143,000 on the number of detectable normal pulsars and 9000 to 100,000 on the number of detectable millisecond pulsars in the Galactic disk. These are consistent with previous estimates. Given the most likely population size in each case (107,000 and 15,000 for normal and millisecond pulsars, respectively), we extend survey detection simulations to predict that, when complete, the full PALFA survey should have detected normal pulsars and millisecond pulsars. Identical estimation techniques predict that normal pulsars and millisecond pulsars would be detected by the beginning of 2014; at the time, the PALFA survey had detected 283 normal pulsars and 31 millisecond pulsars, respectively. We attribute the deficiency in normal pulsar detections predominantly to the radio frequency interference environment at Arecibo and perhaps also scintillation—both effects that are currently not accounted for in population simulation models.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/367,,,,,,,,,,,

Dissemination of the Transmissible Quinolone-Resistance Gene qnrS1 by IncX Plasmids in Nigeria,"The plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance gene qnrS1 was recently found to be commonly associated with ciprofloxacin resistance in Nigeria. We mapped the qnrS1 gene from an Escherichia coli isolate obtained in Nigeria to a 43.5 Kb IncX2 plasmid. The plasmid, pEBG1, was sufficient to confer ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility, as well as tetracycline and trimethoprim resistance, on E. coli K-12. Deletion analysis confirmed that qnrS1 accounted for all the ciprofloxacin non-suceptibility conferred by pEBG1 and tetracycline and trimethoprim resistance could be attributed to tetAR and dfrA14 genes respectively. While it contained a complete IncX conjugation system, pEBG1 was not self-transmissible likely due to an IS3 element inserted between the pilX5 and pilX6 genes. The plasmid was however efficiently mobilizable. pEBG1 was most similar to another qnrS1-bearing IncX2 plasmid from Nigeria, but both plasmids acquired qnrS1 independently and differ in their content of other resistance genes. Screening qnrS1-positive isolates from other individuals in Nigeria revealed that they carried neither pEBG1 nor pNGX2-QnrS1 but that IncX plasmids were prevalent. This study demonstrates that the IncX backbone is a flexible platform that has contributed to qnrS1 dissemination in Nigeria.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/521,,,,,,,,,,,

Fast Radio Burst Discovered in the Arecibo Pulsar ALFA Survey,"Recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated, millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (DMs). These bursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalactic sources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities for probing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new source classes. Until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been detected with the Parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting some concern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. Here we present FRB 121102, the first FRB discovery from a geographic location other than Parkes. FRB 121102 was found in the Galactic anti-center region in the 1.4 GHz Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) survey with the Arecibo Observatory with a DM = 557.4 ± 2.0 pc cm–3, pulse width of 3.0 ± 0.5 ms, and no evidence of interstellar scattering. The observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agrees precisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. Despite its low Galactic latitude (b = –02), the burst has three times the maximum Galactic DM expected along this particular line of sight, suggesting an extragalactic origin. A peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum; we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the ALFA receiver. FRB 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate are all consistent with the properties of the previously detected Parkes bursts.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/366,,,,,,,,,,,

Searching for Pulsars Using Image Pattern Recognition,"In the modern era of big data, many fields of astronomy are generating huge volumes of data, the analysis of which can sometimes be the limiting factor in research. Fortunately, computer scientists have developed powerful data-mining techniques that can be applied to various fields. In this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (AI) program that identifies pulsars from recent surveys by using image pattern recognition with deep neural nets—the PICS  (Pulsar Image-based Classification System) AI. The AI mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interference by looking for patterns from candidate plots. Different from other pulsar selection programs that search for expected patterns, the PICS AI is taught the salient features of different pulsars from a set of human-labeled candidates through machine learning. The training candidates are collected from the Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (PALFA) survey. The information from each pulsar candidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of image data with up to thousands of pixels. The AI takes these data from each candidate as its input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons. The deep neural networks in this AI system grant it superior ability to recognize various types of pulsars as well as their harmonic signals. The trained AI's performance has been validated with a large set of candidates from a different pulsar survey, the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey. In this completely independent test, the PICS ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-related candidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars and 208 of their harmonics, in the top 961 (1%) of 90,008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. The first non-pulsar candidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. In other words, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while 80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. The performance of this system can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. This AI system has been integrated into the PALFA survey pipeline and has discovered six new pulsars to date.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/368,,,,,,,,,,,

The Most Distant Stars in the Milky Way,"We report on the discovery of the most distant Milky Way (MW) stars known to date: ULAS J001535.72+015549.6 and ULAS J074417.48+253233.0. These stars were selected as M giant candidates based on their infrared and optical colors and lack of proper motions. We spectroscopically confirmed them as outer halo giants using the MMT/Red Channel spectrograph. Both stars have large estimated distances, with ULAS J001535.72+015549.6 at 274 ± 74 kpc and ULAS J074417.48+253233.0 at 238 ± 64 kpc, making them the first MW stars discovered beyond 200 kpc. ULAS J001535.72+015549.6 and ULAS J074417.48+253233.0 are both moving away from the Galactic center at 52 ± 10 km s–1 and 24 ± 10 km s–1, respectively. Using their distances and kinematics, we considered possible origins such as: tidal stripping from a dwarf galaxy, ejection from the MW's disk, or membership in an undetected dwarf galaxy. These M giants, along with two inner halo giants that were also confirmed during this campaign, are the first to map largely unexplored regions of our Galaxy's outer halo.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/368,,,,,,,,,,,

The Einstein@Home Search for Radio Pulsars and PSR J2007+2722,"Einstein@Home aggregates the computer power of hundreds of thousands of volunteers from 193 countries, to search for new neutron stars using data from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave detectors. This paper presents a detailed description of the search for new radio pulsars using Pulsar ALFA survey data from the Arecibo Observatory. The enormous computing power allows this search to cover a new region of parameter space; it can detect pulsars in binary systems with orbital periods as short as 11 minutes. We also describe the first Einstein@Home discovery, the 40.8 Hz isolated pulsar PSR J2007+2722, and provide a full timing model. PSR J2007+2722's pulse profile is remarkably wide with emission over almost the entire spin period. This neutron star is most likely a disrupted recycled pulsar, about as old as its characteristic spin-down age of 404 Myr. However, there is a small chance that it was born recently, with a low magnetic field. If so, upper limits on the X-ray flux suggest but cannot prove that PSR J2007+2722 is at least ~100 kyr old. In the future, we expect that the massive computing power provided by volunteers should enable many additional radio pulsar discoveries.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/372,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Carbon Isotope Organic Geochemistry of Early Ordovician Rocks from the Annascaul Formation, County Kerry","Ireland is well known to geologists as containing some of the thickest successions of Early Ordovician (485-470 Ma; Walker et al. 2012) sedimentary rocks in the world. The carbon stable isotope compositions (δ13C value) of similarly aged rocks have been reported for only very few places in the world (i.e., Argentina, southern China, and southern France), and no such analyses have been performed on the Early Ordovician, organic-rich rocks of Ireland. Here we report the δ13C values of bulk organic material and organic isolates recovered from the Annascaul Formation of Southwestern Ireland. Members of the Annascaul Formation spanning the Early Ordovician were sampled at multiple sites within five localities on the Dingle Peninsula, County Kerry. Mean bulk organic δ13C values for the organic matter within rocks of the Farranacarriga, Tinal, Illaunglass, Bealacoon, and Killelton Members ranged from -28.7‰ (Farranacarriga) to -22.1‰ (Illaunglass); the average δ13C values of organics isolated from the Farranacarriga and Bealacoon Members were -29.0 and -28.4‰, respectively. No statistical difference was observed between the δ13C value of isolates and the δ13C value of bulk sediment from which organics had been isolated (P-0.85, Farranacarriga, n-6; P-0.81, Bealacoon, n-5; paired t-test). The δ13C values we present here agree well with the previously published δ13C values for Early Ordovician organic carbon (average = -28.4, -25.4, -25.5‰) from Argentina, southern China, and southern France (respectively). Our new data from the Annascaul Formation are ∼3.3‰ higher than the average value reported for δ13C values of organic matter of marine origin for the same period, raising the possibility that terrestrial bryophytes (or other terrestrial photosynthesizers) contributed to these Early Ordovician sediments. Further equivocal evidence is provided by the abundant organic macerals found within the Farranacarriga Member with possible vitrinite origin. The δ13C values of palynomorphsized organic isolates from the Annascaul Formation reflect a marine origin for these organisms, consistent with their previous identification as acritarchs. Given the recognition of the earliest thalloid macrofossils and land-plant cryptospores in the Middle Ordovician sediments of the Appalachian basin (USA) and Argentina, respectively, our results highlight the Early-Middle Ordovician boundary as a potentially crucial time of terrestrial ecosystem expansion and development.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/480,,,,,,,,,,,

PSR J1723-2837: An Eclipsing Binary Radio Millisecond Pulsar,"We present a study of PSR J1723–2837, an eclipsing, 1.86 ms millisecond binary radio pulsar discovered in the Parkes Multibeam survey. Radio timing indicates that the pulsar has a circular orbit with a 15 hr orbital period, a low-mass companion, and a measurable orbital period derivative. The eclipse fraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the Roche lobe size inferred for the companion. The timing behavior is significantly affected by unmodeled systematics of astrophysical origin, and higher-order orbital period derivatives are needed in the timing solution to account for these variations. We have identified the pulsar's (non-degenerate) companion using archival ultraviolet, optical, and infrared survey data and new optical photometry. Doppler shifts from optical spectroscopy confirm the star's association with the pulsar and indicate a pulsar-to-companion mass ratio of 3.3 ± 0.5, corresponding to a companion mass range of 0.4 to 0.7 M ☉ and an orbital inclination angle range of between 30° and 41°, assuming a pulsar mass range of 1.4-2.0 M ☉. Spectroscopy indicates a spectral type of G for the companion and an inferred Roche-lobe-filling distance that is consistent with the distance estimated from radio dispersion. The features of PSR J1723–2837 indicate that it is likely a ""redback"" system. Unlike the five other Galactic redbacks discovered to date, PSR J1723–2837 has not been detected as a γ-ray source with Fermi. This may be due to an intrinsic spin-down luminosity that is much smaller than the measured value if the unmeasured contribution from proper motion is large.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/370,,,,,,,,,,,

Variability of the Pulsed Radio Emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud Pulsar PSR J0529-6652,"We have studied the variability of PSR J0529–6652, a radio pulsar in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using observations conducted at 1390 MHz with the Parkes 64 m telescope. PSR J0529–6652 is detectable as a single pulse emitter, with amplitudes that classify the pulses as giant pulses. This makes PSR J0529–6652 the second known giant pulse emitter in the LMC, after PSR B0540–69. The fraction of the emitted pulses detectable from PSR J0529–6652 at this frequency is roughly two orders of magnitude greater than it is for either PSR B0540–69 or the Crab pulsar (if the latter were located in the LMC). We have measured a pulse nulling fraction of 83.3% ± 1.5% and an intrinsic modulation index of 4.07 ± 0.29 for PSR J0529–6652. The modulation index is significantly larger than values previously measured for typical radio pulsars but is comparable to values reported for members of several other neutron star classes. The large modulation index, giant pulses, and large nulling fraction suggest that this pulsar is phenomenologically more similar to these other, more variable sources, despite having spin and physical characteristics that are typical of the unrecycled radio pulsar population. The large modulation index also does not appear to be consistent with the small value predicted for this pulsar by a model of polar cap emission outlined by Gil & Sendyk. This conclusion depends to some extent on the assumption that PSR J0529–6652 is exhibiting core emission, as suggested by its simple profile morphology, narrow profile width, and previously measured profile polarization characteristics.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/377,,,,,,,,,,,

We use the waveforms in conjunction with resistive force theory as well as a singularity method to predict a cell's time-dependent velocity for comparison with experiments. While net propulsion is thought to arise from asymmetry between the power and recovery strokes, we show that hydrodynamic interactions between the flagella and cell body on the return stroke make an important contribution to enhance net forward motion.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/506,,,,,,,,,,,

Dressed Return Maps Distinguish Chaotic Mechanisms,"Chaotic data generated by a three-dimensional dynamical system can be embedded into R3 in a number of inequivalent ways. However, when lifted into R5 they all become equivalent, indicating that they all belong to a single universality class sharing a common chaos-generating mechanism. We present a complete invariant determining this universality class and distinguishing attractors generated by distinct mechanisms. This invariant is easily computable from an appropriately “dressed” return map of any particular three-dimensional embedding.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/331,,,,,,,,,,,

Cholera Outbreaks in Nigeria are Associated with Multidrug Resistant Atypical El Tor and non-O1/non-O139 Vibrio cholerae.,"Background
The current millennium has seen a steep rise in the number, size and case-fatalities of cholera outbreaks in many African countries. Over 40,000 cases of cholera were reported from Nigeria in 2010. Variants of Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor biotype have emerged but very little is known about strains causing cholera outbreaks in West Africa, which is crucial for the implementation of interventions to control epidemic cholera.   Methodology/Principal Findings
V. cholerae isolates from outbreaks of acute watery diarrhea in Nigeria from December, 2009 to October, 2010 were identified by standard culture methods. Fifteen O1 and five non-O1/non-O139 strains were analyzed; PCR and sequencing targeted regions associated with virulence, resistance and biotype were performed. We also studied genetic interrelatedness among the strains by multilocus sequence analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The antibiotic susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method and E-test. We found that multidrug resistant atypical El Tor strains, with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol, characterized by the presence of the SXT element, andgyrASer85Leu alleles as well CTX phage and TCP cluster characterized byrstRElTor, ctxB-7 and tcpACIRS alleles, respectively, were largely responsible for cholera outbreaks in 2009 and 2010. We also identified and characterized a V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 lineage from cholera-like diarrhea cases in Nigeria.   Conclusions/Significance
The recent Nigeria outbreaks have been determined by multidrug resistant atypical El Tor and non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strains, and it seems that the typical El Tor, from the beginning of seventh cholera pandemic, is no longer epidemic/endemic in this country. This scenario is similar to the East Africa, Asia and Caribbean countries. The detection of a highly virulent, antimicrobial resistant lineage in Nigeria is worrisome and points to a need for vaccine-based control of the disease. This study has also revealed the putative importance of non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae in diarrheal disease in Nigeria.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/516,,,,,,,,,,,

EQeq plus C: An Empirical Bond-Order-Corrected Extended Charge Equilibration Metho,"The extended charge equilibration, (EQeq) scheme computes atomic partial charges using the experimentally measured ionization potentials and electron affinities of atom. However, EQeq erroneously predicts constant (environment independent) charges for high-oxidation-state transition metals in amine-templated metal oxide (ATMO) compounds, contrary to the variation observed in iterative Hirshfeld (Hirshfeld-I) charges, bond-valence sum calculations, and formal oxidation state calculations. To fix this problem, we present a simple, noniterative empirical pairwise correction based on the Pauling bond-order/distance relationship, which we denote EQeq+C. We parametrized the corrections to reproduce the Hirshfeld-I charges of ATMO compounds and REPEAT charges of metal organic framework (MOP) compounds. The EQeq+C correction fixes the metal charge problem and significantly improves the partial atomic charges compared to EQeq. We demonstrate the transferability of the parametrization by applying it to a set of unrelated dipeptides. After an initial parametrization, the EQeq+C correction requires minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for treating large unit cell solids and performing large-scale computational materials screening.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/370,,,,,,,,,,,

Early Observations and Analysis of the Type 1a SN 2014J in M82,"We present optical and near infrared (NIR) observations of the nearby Type Ia SN 2014J. Seventeen optical and 23 NIR spectra were obtained from 10 days before (-10d) to 10 days after (+10d) the time of maximum B-band brightness. The relative strengths of absorption features and their patterns of development can be compared at one day intervals throughout most of this period. Carbon is not detected in the optical spectra, but we identify C I lambda 1.0693 in the NIR spectra. Mg II lines with high oscillator strengths have higher initial velocities than other Mg II lines. We show that the velocity differences can be explained by differences in optical depths due to oscillator strengths. The spectra of SN 2014J show that it is a normal SN Ia, but many parameters are near the boundaries between normal and high-velocity subclasses. The velocities for OI, Mg II, Si II, S Ca a, and Fell suggest that SN 2014J has a layered structure with little or no mixing. That result is consistent with the delayed detonation explosion models. We also report photometric observations, obtained from -10d to +29d, in the UBVRIJH and K-s bands. The template fitting package SNooPy is used to interpret the light curves and to derive photometric parameters. Using R-v = 1.46, which is consistent with previous studies, SNooPy finds that A(v) = 1.80 for E(B - V)(host) = 1.23 +/- 0.06 mag. The maximum B-band brightness of -19.19 +/- 0.10 mag was reached on February 1.74 UT +/- 0.13 days and the supernova has a decline parameter, Delta m(15), of 1.12 +/- 0.02 mag.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/386,,,,,,,,,,,

"Looking at Difference: Laura Swanson’s Anti-Self-Portraits, Diane Arbus’s Portraits, and the Viewer’s Gaze","The article argues that disability is a resource for revitalizing the practice of portraiture. Drawing on Tobin Siebers’s work on disability aesthetics and Rosemarie Garland-Thomson’s work on staring, the article explores how disability inflects and redefines the conventions of portraiture and how contemporary portraiture revises the photographic history of disability, a history rooted in the medicalization or enfreakment of bodily difference. After briefly surveying the history of photographic representations of variant bodies, consideration is given to the work of Diane Arbus, whose portraits continue to shape the representation of disability, and then to the work of contemporary photographer Laura Swanson, who positions her work in relation to that of Arbus. Swanson reimagines the portrait by resisting the viewer’s gaze and confronting viewers with their expectations of portraiture, their histories of looking, and their encounters with disability and difference.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/writing_facpubs/6,,,,,,,,,,,

Mapping the Local Halo: Statistical Parallax Analysis of SDSS Low-Mass Subdwarfs,"We present a statistical parallax study of nearly 2000 M subdwarfs with photometry and spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Statistical parallax analysis yields the mean absolute magnitudes, mean velocities, and velocity ellipsoids for homogenous samples of stars. We selected homogeneous groups of subdwarfs based on their photometric colors and spectral appearance. We examined the color–magnitude relations of low-mass subdwarfs and quantified their dependence on the newly refined metallicity parameter, ζ. We also developed a photometric metallicity parameter, δ(g − r), based on the g − r and r − z colors of low-mass stars and used it to select stars with similar metallicities. The kinematics of low-mass subdwarfs as a function of color and metallicity were also examined and compared to main-sequence M dwarfs. We find that the SDSS subdwarfs share similar kinematics to the inner halo and thick disk. The color–magnitude relations derived in this analysis will be a powerful tool for identifying and characterizing low-mass metal-poor subdwarfs in future surveys such as Gaia and LSST, making them important and plentiful tracers of the stellar halo.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/369,,,,,,,,,,,

Children's emotional expressivity and teacher perceptions of social competence: A cross-cultural comparison,"Previous research suggests that adult perceptions of children's social competence may vary depending on the socialization goals in a given cultural context. There is also ample evidence of cultural differences in values concerning emotional display, with East Asian collectivistic contexts favoring restraint and Western individualistic contexts favoring open expression of internal states. The present study examined an individualistic versus collectivistic comparison in the links between children's emotional expressivity and teacher evaluations of their social competence. A sample of 127 Korean, Asian American (AA) and European American (EA) preschoolers participated in emotion eliciting tasks and were rated by their teachers on three dimensions of social competence (peer acceptance, prosocial behavior, and antisocial behavior). Moderation analyses revealed that for Korean children, sadness and happiness expressivity were associated with higher antisocial behavior scores, but these associations were reversed or not significant for EAs. For AA children, anger display was associated with lower ratings of peer acceptance and prosocial behavior, but this link did not hold for their EA counterparts. Overall, there was some support for the hypotheses that expressivity was related to lower teacher perceptions of child social competence for a collectivistic group (AA and Korean) but not for an individualistic group (EA). Thus, these findings indicate cultural group differences in teacher perceptions and values of children's emotion expressivity.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/355,,,,,,,,,,,

It is worth stating that when a field changes as rapidly as ours, the production of a textbook proves to be a truly scholarly endeavor, as we read and evaluate new experiments and determine whether they indeed represent a shift in the thinking of that part of the discipline, or merely an interesting new development layered onto a pre-existing foundation.

Bio-Inspired Electroactive Organic Molecules for Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries. 1. Thiophenoquinones,"Redox flow batteries (RFB) utilizing water-soluble organic redox couples are a new strategy for low-cost, eco-friendly, and durable stationary electrical energy storage. Previous studies have focused on benzoquinones, napthoquinones, and anthraquinones as the electroactive species. Here, we explore a new class of molecules—thiophenoquinones—specifically focusing on the caldariellaquinone-, sulfolobusquinone-, and benzodithiophenoquinone-like frameworks that are used for metabolic processes in thermophilic aerobic Sulfolobus archaebacteria. We demonstrated that B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) thermochemical calculations (using the SMD solvation model) reproduce experimental reduction potentials to within ±0.04 V. We then studied the effect of amine, hydroxyl, methyl, fluoro, phosphonic acid, sulfonic acid, carboxylic acid, and nitro functional group modifications on the reduction potential and Gibbs energy of solvation in water (using density functional theory) and aqueous solubility (using cheminformatics). Next we enumerated all of the 10 611 possible combinations of functional group substitutions on these frameworks and identified 1056 potential molecules with solubilities exceeding 2 mol/L; of these, 36 molecules have reduction potentials below 0.25 V and 15 molecules above 0.95 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)). The combination of high solubility and wide voltage range makes these molecules promising candidates for high performance aqueous RFB applications. Finally, using our data set of ab initio reduction potentials, we developed a cheminformatics model that predicts ab initio reduction potentials to within ±0.09 V based solely on molecular connectivity. We found that a model trained with as few as 200 examples generates rank-ordered predictions allowed us to identify the highest performance candidates with half the number of ab initio calculations. This offers a strategy for improving the tractability of future computational searches for high performance RFB molecules.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/372,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigate whether tidal interactions and/or ram pressure stripping are responsible for the formation of the H Itail stretching to the north-east of ESO 324-G024 with the latter being most probable. Furthermore, we closely analyse the sub-structure of Cen A's polarized radio lobes to ascertain whether ESO 324-G024 is located in front, within or behind the northern lobe. Our multiwavelength, multicomponent approach allows us to determine that ESO 324-G024 is most likely behind the northern radio lobe of Cen A. This result helps to constrain the orientation of the lobe, which is likely inclined to our line of sight by approximately 60° if NGC 5128 and ESO 324-G024 are at the same distance.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/412,,,,,,,,,,,

A Search for RR Lyrae Stars in  Segue 2 and Segue 3,"We present an extensive search for RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in and around the ultra-faint Milky Way companions Segue 2 and Segue 3. The former (MV = –2.5) appears to be an extremely faint dwarf galaxy companion of the Milky Way. The latter (MV = 0.0) is among the faintest star clusters known. We use B and V band time-series imaging obtained at the WIYN 0.9 m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory to search for RRL in these objects. In our Segue 2 observations, we present a previously unknown fundamental mode (RRab) RRL star with a period of P ab = 0.748 days. With this measurement, we revisit the inverse correlation between P ab and [Fe/H] established in the literature for Milky Way dwarf galaxies and their RRL. In this context, the long period of Segue 2's RRab star as well as the known significant spread in metallicity in this dwarf galaxy are consistent with the observed trend in P ab and [Fe/H]. We derive the first robust distance to Segue 2, using both its RRab star and spectroscopically confirmed blue horizontal branch stars. Using [Fe/H] = –2.16 and –2.44 dex, we find and kpc; assuming [Fe/H] = –2.257 dex, we find d BHB = 34.4 ± 2.6 kpc. Although no RRL were present in the Segue 3 field, we found a candidate eclipsing binary star system.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/356,,,,,,,,,,,

Antlia B: A Faint Dwarf Galaxy Member of the NGC 3109 Association,"We report the discovery of Antlia B, a faint dwarf galaxy at a projected distance of similar to 72 kpc from NGC 3109 (M-V similar to -15 mag), the primary galaxy of the NGC 3109 dwarf association at the edge of the Local Group. The tip of the red giant branch distance to Antlia B is D = 1.29 +/- 0.10 Mpc, which is consistent with the distance to NGC 3109. A qualitative analysis indicates the new dwarf 's stellar population has both an old, metal-poor red giant branch (greater than or similar to 10 Gyr, [Fe/H] similar to -2), and a younger blue population with an age of similar to 200-400 Myr, analogous to the original Antlia dwarf, another likely satellite of NGC 3109. Antlia B has H I gas at a velocity of v(helio, H I) = 376 kms(-1), confirming the association with NGC 3109 (v(helio) = 403 km s(-1)). The H I gas mass (M-H I = 2.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(5) M-circle dot), stellar luminosity (M-V = -9.7 +/- 0.6 mag) and half light radius (rh = 273 +/- 29 pc) are all consistent with the properties of dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Volume, and is most similar to the Leo P dwarf galaxy. The discovery of Antlia B is the initial result from a Dark Energy Camera survey for halo substructure and faint dwarf companions to NGC 3109 with the goal of comparing observed substructure with expectations from the Lambda+Cold Dark Matter model in the sub-Milky Way regime.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/414,,,,,,,,,,,

Evolution of chemical diversity by coordinated gene swaps in type II polyketide gene clusters,"Natural product biosynthetic pathways generate molecules of enormous structural complexity and exquisitely tuned biological activities. Studies of natural products have led to the discovery of many pharmaceutical agents, particularly antibiotics. Attempts to harness the catalytic prowess of biosynthetic enzyme systems, for both compound discovery and engineering, have been limited by a poor understanding of the evolution of the underlying gene clusters. We developed an approach to study the evolution of biosynthetic genes on a cluster-wide scale, integrating pairwise gene coevolution information with large-scale phylogenetic analysis. We used this method to infer the evolution of type II polyketide gene clusters, tracing the path of evolution from the single ancestor to those gene clusters surviving today. We identified 10 key gene types in these clusters, most of which were swapped in from existing cellular processes and subsequently specialized. The ancestral type II polyketide gene cluster likely comprised a core set of five genes, a roster that expanded and contracted throughout evolution. A key C24 ancestor diversified into major classes of longer and shorter chain length systems, from which a C20 ancestor gave rise to the majority of characterized type II polyketide antibiotics. Our findings reveal that (i) type II polyketide structure is predictable from its gene roster, (ii) only certain gene combinations are compatible, and (iii) gene swaps were likely a key to evolution of chemical diversity. The lessons learned about how natural selection drives polyketide chemical innovation can be applied to the rational design and guided discovery of chemicals with desired structures and properties.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/373,,,,,,,,,,,
The Crown and the Cosmos: Astrology and the Politics of Maximilian I,"Despite its popular association today with magic, astrology was once a complex and sophisticated practice, grounded in technical training provided by a university education. The Crown and the Cosmos examines the complex ways that political practice and astrological discourse interacted at the Habsburg court, a key center of political and cultural power in early modern Europe. Like other monarchs, Maximilian I used astrology to help guide political actions, turning to astrologers and their predictions to find the most propitious times to sign treaties or arrange marriage contracts. Perhaps more significantly, the emperor employed astrology as a political tool to gain support for his reforms and to reinforce his own legitimacy as well as that of the Habsburg dynasty. Darin Hayton analyzes the various rhetorical tools astrologers used to argue for the nobility, antiquity, and utility of their discipline, and how they strove to justify their “science” on the grounds that through its rigorous interpretation of the natural world, astrology could offer more reliable predictions. This book draws on extensive printed and manuscript sources from archives across northern and central Europe, including Poland, Germany, France, and England.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/history_facpubs/305,,,,,,,,,,,

Cofinite Induced Subgraphs of Impartial Combinatorial Games: An Analysis of CIS-Nim,"Given an impartial combinatorial game G, we create a class of related games (CISG) by specifying a finite set of positions in G and forbidding players from moving to those positions (leaving all other game rules unchanged). Such modifications amount to taking cofinite induced subgraphs (CIS) of the original game graph. Some recent numerical/heuristic work has suggested that the underlying structure and behavior of such “CIS-games” can shed new light on, and bears interesting relationships with, the original games from which they are derived. In this paper we present an analytical treatment of the cofinite induced subgraphs associated with the game of (three-heap) Nim. This constitutes one of the simplest nontrivial cases of a CIS game. Our main finding is that although the structure of the winning strategies in games of CIS-Nim can differ greatly from that of Nim, CIS-Nim games inherit a type of period-two scale invariance from the original game of Nim.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/537,,,,,,,,,,,

Discovery of Large Molecular Gas Reservoirs in Post-Starburst Galaxies,"Post-starburst (or ""E+A"") galaxies are characterized by low Hα emission and strong Balmer absorption, suggesting a recent starburst, but little current star formation. Although many of these galaxies show evidence of recent mergers, the mechanism for ending the starburst is not yet understood. To study the fate of the molecular gas, we search for CO(1-0) and (2-1) emission with the IRAM 30 m and SMT 10 m telescopes in 32 nearby (0.01 < z < 0.12) post-starburst galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We detect CO in 17 (53%). Using CO as a tracer for molecular hydrogen, and a Galactic conversion factor, we obtain molecular gas masses of M(H2) = 108.6-109.8 M ☉ and molecular gas mass to stellar mass fractions of ~10–2-10–0.5, comparable to those of star-forming galaxies. The large amounts of molecular gas rule out complete gas consumption, expulsion, or starvation as the primary mechanism that ends the starburst in these galaxies. The upper limits on M(H2) for the 15 undetected galaxies range from 107.7 M ☉ to 109.7 M ☉, with the median more consistent with early-type galaxies than with star-forming galaxies. Upper limits on the post-starburst star formation rates (SFRs) are lower by ~10 × than for star-forming galaxies with the same M(H2). We also compare the molecular gas surface densities () to upper limits on the SFR surface densities (ΣSFR), finding a significant offset, with lower ΣSFR for a given  than is typical for star-forming galaxies. This offset from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation suggests that post-starburst galaxies have lower star formation efficiency, a low CO-to-H2conversion factor characteristic of ultraluminous infrared galaxies, and/or a bottom-heavy initial mass function, although uncertainties in the rate and distribution of current star formation remain.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/410,,,,,,,,,,,

Dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders,"This chapter reviews the dissemination of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for anxiety disorders. The multiple challenges to successful dissemination are germane to any treatment program before it can be made widely available. Several cognitive and behavioral (CBT) treatment programs have been established as EBTs for anxiety disorders. A large body of research has established that CBT programs are the treatment of choice for panic disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The chapter briefly reviews existing models of dissemination, with a focus on those of Shannon Wiltsey Stirman and colleagues. It also reviews some of the efforts to disseminate EBTs for anxiety disorders, with a focus on panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some of the recent efforts in “telehealth,” which comprises interventions that are delivered remotely with the assistance of technology, with varying degrees of therapist involvement, are also discusse",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/288,,,,,,,,,,,

Stochastic Geometric Network Models for Groups of Functional and Structural Connectomes,"Structural and functional connectomes are emerging as important instruments in the study of normal brain function and in the development of new biomarkers for a variety of brain disorders. In contrast to single-network studies that presently dominate the (non-connectome) network literature, connectome analyses typically examine groups of empirical networks and then compare these against standard (stochastic) network models. The current practice in connectome studies is to employ stochastic network models derived from social science and engineering contexts as the basis for the comparison. However, these are not necessarily best suited for the analysis of connectomes, which often contain groups of very closely related networks, such as occurs with a set of controls or a set of patients with a specific disorder. This paper studies important extensions of standard stochastic models that make them better adapted for analysis of connectomes, and develops new statistical fitting methodologies that account for inter-subject variations. The extensions explicitly incorporate geometric information about a network based on distances and inter/intra hemispherical asymmetries (to supplement ordinary degree-distribution information), and utilize a stochastic choice of network density levels (for fixed threshold networks) to better capture the variance in average connectivity among subjects. The new statistical tools introduced here allow one to compare groups of networks by matching both their average characteristics and the variations among them. A notable finding is that connectomes have high ""smallworldness"" beyond that arising from geometric and degree considerations alone.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/534,,,,,,,,,,,

Directed Progression Brain Networks in Alzheimer's Disease: Properties and Classification,"This article introduces a new approach in brain connectomics aimed at characterizing the temporal spread in the brain of pathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main instrument is the development of ""directed progression networks"" (DPNets), wherein one constructs directed edges between nodes based on (weakly) inferred directions of the temporal spreading of the pathology. This stands in contrast to many previously studied brain networks where edges represent correlations, physical connections, or functional progressions. In addition, this is one of a few studies showing the value of using directed networks in the study of AD. This article focuses on the construction of DPNets for AD using longitudinal cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance imaging data. The network properties are then characterized, providing new insights into AD progression, as well as novel markers for differentiating normal cognition (NC) and AD at the group level. It also demonstrates the important role of nodal variations for network classification (i.e., the significance of standard deviations, not just mean values of nodal properties). Finally, the DPNets are utilized to classify subjects based on their global network measures using a variety of data-mining methodologies. In contrast to most brain networks, these DPNets do not show high clustering and small-world properties.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/535,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparative Genomics of 274 Vibrio Cholerae Genomes Reveals Mobile Functions Structuring Three Niche Dimensions,"Vibrio cholerae is a globally dispersed pathogen that has evolved with humans for centuries, but also includes non-pathogenic environmental strains. Here, we identify the genomic variability underlying this remarkable persistence across the three major niche dimensions space, time, and habitat. Taking an innovative approach of genome-wide association applicable to microbial genomes (GWAS-M), we classify 274 complete V. cholerae genomes by niche, including 39 newly sequenced for this study with the Ion Torrent DNA-sequencing platform. Niche metadata were collected for each strain and analyzed together with comprehensive annotations of genetic and genomic attributes, including point mutations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs), protein families, functions and prophages. Our analysis revealed that genomic variations, in particular mobile functions including phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids underlie the metadata structuring in each of the three niche dimensions. This underscores the role of phages and mobile elements as the most rapidly evolving elements in bacterial genomes, creating local endemicity (space), leading to temporal divergence (time), and allowing the invasion of new habitats. Together, we take a data-driven approach for comparative functional genomics that exploits high-volume genome sequencing and annotation, in conjunction with novel statistical and machine learning analyses to identify connections between genotype and phenotype on a genome-wide scale.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/483,,,,,,,,,,,

The Factory and the Beehive. II. Activity and Rotation is Praesepe and the Hyades,"Open clusters are collections of stars with a single, well-determined age, and can be used to investigate the connections between angular-momentum evolution and magnetic activity over a star's lifetime. We present the results of a comparative study of the relationship between stellar rotation and activity in two benchmark open clusters: Praesepe and the Hyades. As they have the same age and roughly solar metallicity, these clusters serve as an ideal laboratory for testing the agreement between theoretical and empirical rotation-activity relations at 600 Myr. We have compiled a sample of 720 spectra—more than half of which are new observations—for 516 high-confidence members of Praesepe; we have also obtained 139 new spectra for 130 high-confidence Hyads. We have also collected rotation periods (P rot) for 135 Praesepe members and 87 Hyads. To compare Hα emission, an indicator of chromospheric activity, as a function of color, mass, and Rossby number Ro , we first calculate an expanded set of χ values, with which we can obtain the Hα to bolometric luminosity ratio, L Hα/L bol, even when spectra are not flux-calibrated and/or stars lack reliable distances. Our χ values cover a broader range of stellar masses and colors (roughly equivalent to spectral types from K0 to M9), and exhibit better agreement between independent calculations, than existing values. Unlike previous authors, we find no difference between the two clusters in their Hα equivalent width or L Hα/L bol distributions, and therefore take the merged Hα and P rot data to be representative of 600 Myr old stars. Our analysis shows that Hα activity in these stars is saturated for . Above that value activity declines as a power-law with slope , before dropping off rapidly at Ro  0.4. These data provide a useful anchor for calibrating the age-activity-rotation relation beyond 600 Myr.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/364,,,,,,,,,,,

Serotonin transporter genotype modulates functional connectivity between amygdala and PCC/PCu during mood recovery,"The short (S) allele of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) has been associated with increased susceptibility to depression. Previous neuroimaging studies have consistently showed increased amygdala activity during the presentation of negative stimuli or regulation of negative emotion in the homozygous short allele carriers, suggesting the key role of amygdala response in mediating increased risk for depression. The brain default mode network (DMN) has also been shown to modulate amygdala activity. However, it remains unclear whether 5-HTTLPR genetic variation modulates functional connectivity (FC) between the amygdala and regions of DMN. In this study, we re-analyzed our previous imaging dataset and examined the effects of 5-HTTLPR genetic variation on amygdala connectivity. A total of 15 homozygous short (S/S) and 15 homozygous long individuals (L/L) were scanned in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during four blocks: baseline, sad mood, mood recovery, and return to baseline. The S/S and L/L groups showed a similar pattern of FC and no differences were found between the two groups during baseline and sad mood scans. However, during mood recovery, the S/S group showed signiﬁcantly reduced anti-correlation between amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu) compared to the L/L group. Moreover, PCC/PCu-amygdala connectivity correlated with amygdala activity in the S/S group but not the L/L group. These results suggest that 5-HTTLPR genetic variation modulates amygdala connectivity which subsequently affects its activity during mood regulation, providing an additional mechanism by which the S allele confers depression risk.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/228,,,,,,,,,,,

In two studies, the model was supported in undergraduate and community samples, and for general commitment to the environment as well as commitment to specific proenvironmental behaviors. Individuals who are satisfied with and invested in the natural world, and who believe that those close to them value it as well, are likely to be committed to the environment and be willing to forego selfish interests to behave proenvironmentally.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/354,,,,,,,,,,,

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli Have Evolved Independently as Distinct Complexes within the E-coli Population with Varying Ability to Cause Disease,"Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is an established diarrhoeagenic pathotype. The association with virulence gene content and ability to cause disease has been studied but little is known about the population structure of EAEC and how this pathotype evolved. Analysis by Multi Locus Sequence Typing of 564 EAEC isolates from cases and controls in Bangladesh, Nigeria and the UK spanning the past 29 years, revealed multiple successful lineages of EAEC. The population structure of EAEC indicates some clusters are statistically associated with disease or carriage, further highlighting the heterogeneous nature of this group of organisms. Different clusters have evolved independently as a result of both mutational and recombination events; the EAEC phenotype is distributed throughout the population of E. coli.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/524,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of a Circadian Output Circuit for Rest:Activity Rhythms in Drosophilia,"Though much is known about the cellular and molecular components of the circadian clock, output pathways that couple clock cells to overt behaviors have not been identified. We conducted a screen for circadian-relevant neurons in the Drosophila brain and report here that cells of the pars intercerebralis (PI), a functional homolog of the mammalian hypothalamus, comprise an important component of the circadian output pathway for rest:activity rhythms. GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) analysis demonstrates that PI cells are connected to the clock through a polysynaptic circuit extending from pacemaker cells to PI neurons. Molecular profiling of relevant PI cells identified the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) homolog, DH44, as a circadian output molecule that is specifically expressed by PI neurons and is required for normal rest:activity rhythms. Notably, selective activation or ablation of just six DH44+ PI cells causes arrhythmicity. These findings delineate a circuit through which clock cells can modulate locomotor rhythms.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/342,,,,,,,,,,,

The Dearth of Neutral Hydrogen in Galactic Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies,"We present new upper limits on the neutral hydrogen (H i) content within the stellar half-light ellipses of 15 Galactic dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), derived from pointed observations with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) as well as Arecibo L-band Fast ALFA survey and Galactic All-Sky Survey data. All of the limits  are more stringent than previously reported values, and those from the GBT improve upon constraints in the literature by a median factor of 23. Normalizing by V-band luminosity LV and dynamical mass Mdyn, we find  and , irrespective of location in the Galactic halo. Comparing these relative H i contents to those of the Local Group and nearby neighbor dwarfs compiled by McConnachie, we find that the Galactic dSphs are extremely gas-poor. Our H i upper limits therefore provide the clearest picture yet of the environmental dependence of the H i content in Local Volume dwarfs. If ram pressure stripping explains the dearth of H i in these systems, then orbits in a relatively massive Milky Way are favored for the outer halo dSph Leo I, while Leo II and Canes Venatici I have had a pericentric passage in the past. For Draco and Ursa Minor, the interstellar medium mass that should accumulate through stellar mass loss in between pericentric passages exceeds  by a factor of ~30. In Ursa Minor, this implies that either this material is not in the atomic phase, or that another mechanism clears the recycled gas on shorter timescales.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/367,,,,,,,,,,,

A New Sample of Cool Subdwarfs from SDSS: Properties and Kinematics,"We present a new sample of M subdwarfs compiled from the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With 3517 new subdwarfs, this new sample significantly increases the number of spectroscopically confirmed low-mass subdwarfs. This catalog also includes 905 extreme and 534 ultra sudwarfs. We present the entire catalog, including observed and derived quantities, and template spectra created from co-added subdwarf spectra. We show color–color and reduced proper motion diagrams of the three metallicity classes, which are shown to separate from the disk dwarf population. The extreme and ultra subdwarfs are seen at larger values of reduced proper motion, as expected for more dynamically heated populations. We determine 3D kinematics for all of the stars with proper motions. The color–magnitude diagrams show a clear separation of the three metallicity classes with the ultra and extreme subdwarfs being significantly closer to the main sequence than the ordinary subdwarfs. All subdwarfs lie below (fainter) and to the left (bluer) of the main sequence. Based on the average (U, V, W) velocities and their dispersions, the extreme and ultra subdwarfs likely belong to the Galactic halo, while the ordinary subdwarfs are likely part of the old Galactic (or thick) disk. An extensive activity analysis of subdwarfs is performed using Hα emission, and 208 active subdwarfs are found. We show that while the activity fraction of subdwarfs rises with spectral class and levels off at the latest spectral classes, consistent with the behavior of M dwarfs, the extreme and ultra subdwarfs are basically flat.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/413,,,,,,,,,,,

A Measurement of the Millimetre Emission and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect Associated with Low-frequency Radio Sources,"We present a statistical analysis of the millimetre-wavelength properties of 1.4 GHz-selected sources and a detection of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect associated with the haloes that host them. We stack data at 148, 218 and 277 GHz from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope at the positions of a large sample of radio AGN selected at 1.4 GHz. The thermal SZ effect associated with the haloes that host the AGN is detected at the 5 sigma level through its spectral signature, representing a statistical detection of the SZ effect in some of the lowest mass haloes (average M-200 approximate to 10(13) M-circle dot h(70)(-1)) studied to date. The relation between the SZ effect and mass (based on weak lensing measurements of radio galaxies) is consistent with that measured by Planck for local bright galaxies. In the context of galaxy evolution models, this study confirms that galaxies with radio AGN also typically support hot gaseous haloes. Adding Herschel observations allows us to show that the SZ signal is not significantly contaminated by dust emission. Finally, we analyse the contribution of radio sources to the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/363,,,,,,,,,,,

Einstein@Home Discovery of 24 Pulsars in the Parkes Multi-Beam Pulsar Survey,"We have conducted a new search for radio pulsars in compact binary systems in the Parkes multi-beam pulsar survey (PMPS) data, employing novel methods to remove the Doppler modulation from binary motion. This has yielded unparalleled sensitivity to pulsars in compact binaries. The required computation time of 17, 000 CPU core years was provided by the distributed volunteer computing project Einstein@Home, which has a sustained computing power of about 1 PFlop s–1. We discovered 24 new pulsars in our search, 18 of which were isolated pulsars, and 6 were members of binary systems. Despite the wide filterbank channels and relatively slow sampling time of the PMPS data, we found pulsars with very large ratios of dispersion measure (DM) to spin period. Among those is PSR J1748–3009, the millisecond pulsar with the highest known DM (420 pc cm–3). We also discovered PSR J1840–0643, which is in a binary system with an orbital period of 937 days, the fourth largest known. The new pulsar J1750–2536 likely belongs to the rare class of intermediate-mass binary pulsars. Three of the isolated pulsars show long-term nulling or intermittency in their emission, further increasing this growing family. Our discoveries demonstrate the value of distributed volunteer computing for data-driven astronomy and the importance of applying new analysis methods to extensively searched data.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/371,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnostic Schemes for Reducing Epidemic Size of African Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreaks,"Introduction: Viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) outbreaks, with high mortality rates, have often been amplified in African health institutions due to person-to-person transmission via infected body fluids. By collating and analyzing epidemiological data from documented outbreaks, we observed that diagnostic delay contributes to epidemic size for Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. Methodology: We used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model and data from the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo, to simulate Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemics. Our model allows us to describe the dynamics for hospital staff separately from that for the general population, and to implement health worker-specific interventions. Results: The model illustrates that implementing World Health Organization/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines of isolating patients who do not respond to antimalarial and antibacterial chemotherapy reduces total outbreak size, from a median of 236, by 90% or more. Routinely employing diagnostic testing in post-mortems of patients that died of refractory fevers reduces the median outbreak size by a further 60%. Even greater reductions in outbreak size were seen when all febrile patients were tested for endemic infections or when febrile health-care workers were tested. The effect of testing strategies was not impaired by the 1-3 day delay that would occur if testing were performed by a reference laboratory. Conclusion: In addition to improving the quality of care for common causes of febrile infections, increased and strategic use of laboratory diagnostics for fever could reduce the chance of hospital amplification of VHFs in resource-limited African health systems.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/522,,,,,,,,,,,

"Hierarchical networks, power laws, and neuronal avalanches","We show that in networks with a hierarchical architecture, critical dynamical behaviors can emerge even when the underlying dynamical processes are not critical. This finding provides explicit insight into current studies of the brain's neuronal network showing power-lawavalanches in neural recordings, and provides a theoretical justification of recent numerical findings. Our analysis shows how the hierarchical organization of a network can itself lead to power-law distributions of avalanche sizes and durations, scaling laws between anomalous exponents, and universal functions—even in the absence of self-organized criticality or critical points. This hierarchy-induced phenomenon is independent of, though can potentially operate in conjunction with, standard dynamical mechanisms for generating power laws.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/538,,,,,,,,,,,

History Dependent Quantum Random Walks as Quantum Lattice Gas Automata,"Quantum Random Walks (QRW) were first defined as one-particle sectors of Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA). Recently, they have been generalized to include history dependence, either on previous coin (internal, i.e., spin or velocity) states or on previous position states. These models have the goal of studying the transition to classicality, or more generally, changes in the performance of quantum walks in algorithmic applications. We show that several history dependent QRW can be identified as one-particle sectors of QLGA. This provides a unifying conceptual framework for these models in which the extra degrees of freedom required to store the history information arise naturally as geometrical degrees of freedom on the lattice.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/359,,,,,,,,,,,

"Submillimetre Galaxies in a Hierarchical Universe: Number Counts, Redshift Distribution, and  Implications for the IMF","High-redshift submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are some of the most rapidly star-forming galaxies in the Universe. Historically, galaxy formation models have had difficulty explaining the observed number counts of SMGs. We combine a semi-empirical model with 3D hydrodynamical simulations and 3D dust radiative transfer to predict the number counts of unlensed SMGs. Because the stellar mass functions, gas and dust masses, and sizes of our galaxies are constrained to match observations, we can isolate uncertainties related to the dynamical evolution of galaxy mergers and the dust radiative transfer. The number counts and redshift distributions predicted by our model agree well with observations. Isolated disc galaxies dominate the faint (S1.1 ≲ 1 or S850 ≲ 2 mJy) population. The brighter sources are a mix of merger-induced starbursts and galaxy-pair SMGs; the latter subpopulation accounts for ∼30–50 per cent of all SMGs at all S1.1 ≳ 0.5 mJy (S850 ≳ 1 mJy). The mean redshifts are ∼3.0–3.5, depending on the flux cut, and the brightest sources tend to be at higher redshifts. Because the galaxy-pair SMGs will be resolved into multiple fainter sources by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the bright ALMA counts should be as much as two times less than those observed using single-dish telescopes. The agreement between our model, which uses a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF), and observations suggests that the IMF in high-redshift starbursts need not be top heavy; if the IMF were top heavy, our model would overpredict the number counts. We conclude that the difficulty some models have reproducing the observed SMG counts is likely indicative of more general problems – such as an underprediction of the abundance of massive galaxies or a star formation rate and stellar mass relation normalization lower than that observed – rather than a problem specific to the SMG population.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/329,,,,,,,,,,,

Integral Field Spectroscopy of 2.0,"We present 2D, integral field spectroscopy covering the rest-frame wavelengths of strong optical emission lines in nine submillimetre luminous galaxies (SMGs) at 2.0 < z < 2.7. The Gemini-North/Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) and Very Large Telescope (VLT) Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared (SINFONI) imaging spectroscopy allow the mapping of the gas morphologies and dynamics within the sources, and we measure an average Hα velocity dispersion of 〈σ〉 = 220 ± 80 km s−1 and an average half-light radius of 〈r1/2〉 = 3.7 ± 0.8 kpc. The dynamical measure, 〈Vobs/2σ〉 = 0.9 ± 0.1, for the SMGs is higher than in more quiescent star-forming galaxies at the same redshift, highlighting a difference in the dynamics of the two populations. The far-infrared star formation rates (SFRs) of the SMGs, measured using Herschel-SPIRE† far-infrared photometry, are on average 370 ± 90 M⊙ yr−1, which is ∼2 times higher than the extinction-corrected SFRs of the more quiescent star-forming galaxies. Six of the SMGs in our sample show strong evidence for kinematically distinct multiple components with average velocity offsets of 200 ± 100 km s−1 and average projected spatial offsets of 8 ± 2 kpc, which we attribute to systems in the early stages of major mergers. Indeed, all SMGs are classified as mergers from a kinemetry analysis of the velocity and dispersion field asymmetry. We bring together our sample with the seven other SMGs with integral field unit observations to describe the ionized gas morphologies and kinematics in a sample of 16 SMGs. By comparing the velocity and spatial offsets of the SMG Hα components with subhalo offsets in the Millennium Simulation data base, we infer an average halo mass for SMGs in the range of 13 < log (M[h−1 M⊙]) < 14. Finally, we explore the relationship between the velocity dispersion and star formation intensity within the SMGs, finding that the gas motions are consistent with the Kennicutt–Schmidt law and a range of extinction corrections, although they might also be driven by the tidal torques from merging or even the star formation itself.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/354,,,,,,,,,,,
Calcium-Dependent Interaction of Calmodulin with Human 80S Ribosomes and Polyribosomes,"Ribosomes are the protein factories of every living cell. The process protein translation is highly complex and tightly regulated by a large number of diverse RNAs and proteins. Earlier studies indicate that Ca2+ plays a role in protein translation. Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein, regulates a large number of proteins participating in many signaling pathways. Several 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins have been identified to interact with CaM, and here, we report that CaM binds with high affinity to 80S ribosomes and polyribosomes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. No binding is observed in buffer with 6mM Mg2+ and 1 mM EGTA that chelated Ca2+, suggesting high specificity of the CaM-ribosome interaction dependent on the Ca2+ induced conformational change of CaM. The interactions between CaM and ribosomes are inhibited by synthetic peptides comprising putative CaM-binding sites in ribosomal proteins S2 and L14. Using a cell-free in vitro translations system, we further found that these synthetic peptides are potent inhibitors of protein synthesis. Our results identify an involvement of CaM in the translational activity of ribosomes. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/26,,,,,,,,,,,

PEACE: Pulsar Evaluation Algorithm for Candidate Extraction - A Software Package for Post-analysis Processing of Pulsar Survey Candidates,"Modern radio pulsar surveys produce a large volume of prospective candidates, the majority of which are polluted by human-created radio frequency interference or other forms of noise. Typically, large numbers of candidates need to be visually inspected in order to determine if they are real pulsars. This process can be labour intensive. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm called Pulsar Evaluation Algorithm for Candidate Extraction (PEACE) which improves the efficiency of identifying pulsar signals. The algorithm ranks the candidates based on a score function. Unlike popular machine-learning-based algorithms, no prior training data sets are required. This algorithm has been applied to data from several large-scale radio pulsar surveys. Using the human-based ranking results generated by students in the Arecibo Remote Command Center programme, the statistical performance of PEACE was evaluated. It was found that PEACE ranked 68 per cent of the student-identified pulsars within the top 0.17 per cent of sorted candidates, 95 per cent within the top 0.34 per cent and 100 per cent within the top 3.7 per cent. This clearly demonstrates that PEACE significantly increases the pulsar identification rate by a factor of about 50 to 1000. To date, PEACE has been directly responsible for the discovery of 47 new pulsars, 5 of which are millisecond pulsars that may be useful for pulsar timing based gravitational-wave detection projects.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/373,,,,,,,,,,,

The Modality-Specific Contribution of Peptidergic and Non-Peptidergic Nociceptors is Manifest at the Level of Dorsal Horn Nociresponsive Neurons,"We previously demonstrated that genetic and/or pharmacological ablation of the TRPV1+/peptidergic or the MrgprD+/non-peptidergic subset of nociceptors produced selective, modality-specific deficits in the behavioural responses to heat and mechanical stimuli, respectively. To assess whether this modality-specific contribution is also manifest at the level of spinal cord neuron responsiveness, here we made extracellular recordings from lumbar dorsal horn neurons of the mouse in response to graded thermal and mechanical stimulation. We found that, following intrathecal injection of capsaicin to eliminate the central terminals of TRPV1+ nociceptors, neurons in the region of laminae I and V of the spinal cord lost responsiveness to noxious heat (whether generated by a contact heat probe or diode laser), with no change in their response to noxious mechanical stimulation.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/341,,,,,,,,,,,

Star Formation in Galaxy Mergers with Realistic Models of Stellar Feedback and the Interstellar  Medium,"We use hydrodynamic simulations with detailed, explicit models for stellar feedback to study galaxy mergers. These high-resolution (∼1 pc) simulations follow the formation and destruction of individual giant molecular clouds (GMC) and star clusters. We find that the final starburst is dominated by in situ star formation, fuelled by gas which flows inwards due to global torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation. The gas is self-gravitating, and forms massive (≲1010 M⊙) GMC and subsequently super star clusters (with masses up to 108 M⊙). However, in contrast to some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the central bulge are not born in super-clusters which then sink to the centre of the galaxy. This is because feedback efficiently disperses GMC after they turn several per cent of their mass into stars. In other words, most of the mass that reaches the nucleus does so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt–Schmidt law emerges naturally as a consequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the small-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this relation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from infrared photons, extend, with no fine-tuning, over seven decades in star formation rate (SFR) to regulate star formation in the most extreme starburst systems with densities ≳104 M⊙ pc−2. This feedback also drives super-winds with large mass-loss rates; however, a significant fraction of the wind material falls back on to the discs at later times, leading to higher post-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. This suggests that strong active galactic nucleus feedback may be required to explain the sharp cut-offs in SFR that are observed in post-merger galaxies. We compare the results to those from simulations with no explicit resolution of GMC or feedback [‘effective equation-of-state’ (EOS) models]. We find that global galaxy properties are similar between EOS and resolved-feedback models. The relic structure and mass profile, and the total mass of stars formed in the nuclear starburst are quite similar, as is the morphological structure during and after mergers (tails, bridges, etc.). Disc survival in sufficiently gas rich mergers is similar in the two cases, and the new models follow the same scalings as derived for the efficiency of disc re-formation after a merger as derived from previous work with the simplified EOS models. While the global galaxy properties are similar between EOS and feedback models,",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/350,,,,,,,,,,,

Star Formation and Gas Kinematics of Quasar Host Galaxies at z~6: New Insights from ALMA,"We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the [C II] 158 μm fine structure line and dust continuum emission from the host galaxies of five redshift 6 quasars. We also report complementary observations of 250 GHz dust continuum and CO (6-5) line emission from the z = 6.00 quasar SDSS J231038.88+185519.7 using the IRAM facilities. The ALMA observations were carried out in the extended array at 0.''7 resolution. We have detected the line and dust continuum in all five objects. The derived [C II] line luminosities are 1.6 × 109 to 8.7 × 109 L ☉ and the [C II]-to-FIR luminosity ratios are 2.9-5.1 ×10–4, which is comparable to the values found in other high-redshift quasar-starburst systems and local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. The sources are marginally resolved and the intrinsic source sizes (major axis FWHM) are constrained to be 0.''3-0.''6 (i.e., 1.7-3.5 kpc) for the [C II] line emission and 0.''2-0.''4 (i.e., 1.2-2.3 kpc) for the continuum. These measurements indicate that there is vigorous star formation over the central few kpc in the quasar host galaxies. The ALMA observations also constrain the dynamical properties of the star-forming gas in the nuclear region. The intensity-weighted velocity maps of three sources show clear velocity gradients. Such velocity gradients are consistent with a rotating, gravitationally bound gas component, although they are not uniquely interpreted as such. Under the simplifying assumption of rotation, the implied dynamical masses within the [C II]-emitting regions are of order 1010-1011 M ☉. Given these estimates, the mass ratios between the supermassive black holes and the spheroidal bulge are an order of magnitude higher than the mean value found in local spheroidal galaxies, which is in agreement with results from previous CO observations of high redshift quasars.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/348,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapid evolution of fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli in Nigeria is temporally associated with fluoroquinolone use,"The genetic basis for antimicrobial resistance was studied in fecal Escherichia coli isolates in a Nigerian community in parallel with antimicrobial use. The results showed that fluoroquinolones, and not chloroquine as has been hypothesized elsewhere, appear to be the selective force for fluoroquinolone-resistant fecal E. coli in this setting.

Arecibo PALFA Survey and Einstein@Home: Binary Pulsar Discovery by Volunteer Computing,"We report the discovery of the 20.7 ms binary pulsar J1952+2630, made using the distributed computing project Einstein@Home in Pulsar ALFA survey observations with the Arecibo telescope. Follow-up observations with the Arecibo telescope confirm the binary nature of the system. We obtain a circular orbital solution with an orbital period of 9.4 hr, a projected orbital radius of 2.8 lt-s, and a mass function of f = 0.15 M ☉ by analysis of spin period measurements. No evidence of orbital eccentricity is apparent; we set a 2σ upper limit e 1.7 × 10–3. The orbital parameters suggest a massive white dwarf companion with a minimum mass of 0.95 M ☉, assuming a pulsar mass of 1.4 M ☉. Most likely, this pulsar belongs to the rare class of intermediate-mass binary pulsars. Future timing observations will aim to determine the parameters of this system further, measure relativistic effects, and elucidate the nature of the companion star.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/374,,,,,,,,,,,
Vision and Authenticity in Heschel's The Sabbath,"Heschel's account of Jewish authenticity is deeply embedded in visual models of phenomenological experience. His portrayal of sabbatical time as a revelatory moment of the ineffable requires a visual practice in which Jews unlearn consumerist forms of gazing at objects in space. To experience the Sabbath as authentically Jewish, Heschel argues here, Jews must see things differently. In this sense, authenticity is a practice furthered by visual knowledge. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/religion_facpubs/46,,,,,,,,,,,

The Globular Cluster Population of NGC 7457: Clues to the Evolution of Field S0 Galaxies,"In this paper, we present the results of a wide-field imaging study of the globular cluster (GC) system of the field S0 galaxy NGC 7457. To derive the global properties of the GC system, we obtained deep BVR images with the WIYN 3.5 m telescope and Minimosaic Imager and studied the GC population of NGC 7457 to a projected radius of ~30 kpc. Our ground-based data were combined with archival and published Hubble Space Telescope data to probe the properties of the GC system close to the galaxy center and reduce contamination in the GC candidate sample from foreground stars and background galaxies. We performed surface photometry of NGC 7457 and compared the galaxy's surface brightness profile with the surface density profile of the GC system. The profiles have similar shapes in the inner 1' (3.9 kpc), but the GC system profile appears to flatten relative to the galaxy light at larger radii. The GC system of NGC 7457 is noticeably elliptical in our images; we measure  = 0.66 ± 0.14 for the GC distribution, which is consistent with our measured ellipticity of the galaxy light. We integrated the radial surface density profile of the GC system to derive a total number of GCs, NGC = 210 ± 30. The GC specific frequencies normalized by the galaxy luminosity and mass are SN = 3.1 ± 0.7 and T = 4.8 ± 1.1, respectively. Comparing the derived GC system properties and other empirical data for NGC 7457 to S0 formation scenarios suggests that this field S0 galaxy may have formed in an unequal-mass merger.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/380,,,,,,,,,,,

Resolving the Generation of Starburst Winds in Galaxy Mergers,"We study galaxy superwinds driven in major mergers, using pc-scale resolution simulations with detailed models for stellar feedback that can self-consistently follow the generation of winds. The models include molecular cooling, star formation at high densities in giant molecular clouds, and gas recycling and feedback from supernovae (I and II), stellar winds and radiation pressure. We study mergers of systems from Small-Magellanic-Cloud-like dwarfs and Milky Way analogues to z ∼ 2 starburst discs. Multiphase superwinds are generated in all passages, with outflow rates up to ∼1000 M⊙ yr−1. However, the wind mass-loading efficiency (outflow rate divided by star formation rate, SFR) is similar to that in the isolated galaxy counterparts of each merger: it depends more on global galaxy properties (mass, size and escape velocity) than on the dynamical state or orbital parameters of the merger. Winds tend to be bi- or unipolar, but multiple ‘events’ build up complex morphologies with overlapping, differently oriented bubbles and shells at a range of radii. The winds have complex velocity and phase structure, with material at a range of speeds up to ∼1000 km s−1 (forming a Hubble-like flow), and a mix of molecular, ionized and hot gas that depends on galaxy properties. We examine how these different phases are connected to different feedback mechanisms. These simulations resolve a problem in some ‘subgrid’ models, where simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-induced starbursts, often making it impossible to form Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). Despite large mass-loading factors (≳10–20) in the winds simulated here, the peak SFRs are comparable to those in ‘no wind’ simulations. Wind acceleration does not act equally, so cold dense gas can still lose angular momentum and form stars, while these stars blow out gas that would not have participated in the starburst in the first place. Considerable wind material is not unbound, and falls back on the disc at later times post-merger, leading to higher post-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. We consider different simulation numerical methods and their effects on the wind phase structure; while most results are converged, we find that the existence of small clumps in the outflow at large distances from the galaxy is quite sensitive to the methodology.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/349,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor NR4A1 (Nur77) controls bone marrow differentiation and the survival of Ly6C(-) monocytes,"This paper, in one of the best immunology journals in the world (really), was the result of a wonderful collaboration between three labs - ours at Haverford, Geissman's in London, and Lynn Hedrick's it the La Jolla Allergy and Immunology Institute in California.  Lynn spearheaded the study and contacted me about the possibility of using our new reporter mice.  It turned out that we (truly Harper Hubbeling '11, a Beckman Scholar in my laboratory) had already been doing some of the experiments she was proposing.  We decided to incorporate our data with hers - and she boldly sent the work to Nature Immunology. After some revisions, they accepted it - a very, very exciting time and publication for us - and for Harper. The paper shows that the gene Nur77 (which regulate cell fates in way we are still working to understand) is critical for the development and function of a special population of white blood cells (patrolling monocytes).  Rather than enhance inflammation, these cells quell it and are likely to play an important role in maintaining an organisms' health between infections. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/410,,,,,,,,,,,

Timing and Interstellar Scattering of Thirty-five Distant Pulsars Discovered in the PALFA Survey,"We have made extensive observations of 35 distant slow (non-recycled) pulsars discovered in the ongoing Arecibo PALFA pulsar survey. Timing observations of these pulsars over several years at Arecibo Observatory and Jodrell Bank Observatory have yielded high-precision positions and measurements of rotation properties. Despite being a relatively distant population, these pulsars have properties that mirror those of the previously known pulsar population. Many of the sources exhibit timing noise, and one underwent a small glitch. We have used multifrequency data to measure the interstellar scattering properties of these pulsars. We find scattering to be higher than predicted along some lines of sight, particularly in the Cygnus region. Finally, we present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the youngest and most energetic of the pulsars, J1856+0245, which has previously been associated with the GeV-TeV pulsar wind nebula HESS J1857+026.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/379,,,,,,,,,,,
"Simultaneous Planck, Swift, and Fermi observations of X-ray and gamma-ray selected blazars","We present simultaneous Planck, Swift, Fermi, and ground-based data for 105 blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft X-ray, hard X-ray, and gamma-ray bands, with additional 5GHz flux-density limits to ensure a good probability of a Planck detection. We compare our results to those of a companion paper presenting simultaneous Planck and multi-frequency observations of 104 radio-loud northern active galactic nuclei selected at radio frequencies. While we confirm several previous results, our unique data set allows us to demonstrate that the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biases that cannot be ignored. Almost all the BL Lac objects have been detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), whereas 30% to 40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) in the radio, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray selected samples are still below the gamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of Fermi-LAT data. The radio to sub-millimetre spectral slope of blazars is quite flat, with similar to 0 up to about 70GHz, above which it steepens to similar to -0.65. The BL Lacs have significantly flatter spectra than FSRQs at higher frequencies. The distribution of the rest-frame synchrotron peak frequency (nu(S)(peak)) in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of FSRQs is the same in all the blazar samples with = 10(13.1+.1) Hz, while the mean inverse Compton peak frequency, , ranges from 10(21) to 10(22) Hz. The distributions of nu(S)(peak) and nu(S)(peak) of BL Lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energies than those of FSRQs; their shapes strongly depend on the selection method. The Compton dominance of blazars, defined as the ratio of the inverse Compton to synchrotron peak luminosities, ranges from less than 0.2 to nearly 100, with only FSRQs reaching values larger than about 3. Its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method, with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at similar to 7 or more, and radio-selected blazars at values close to 1, thus implying that the common assumption that the blazar power budget is largely dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. A comparison of our multi-frequency data with theoretical predictions shows that simple homogeneous SSC models cannot explain the simultaneous SEDs of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in all samples. The SED of the blazars that were not detected by Fermi-LAT may instead be consistent with SSC emission. Our data challenge the correlation between bolometric",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/208,,,,,,,,,,,

Neural and behavioral measures of error-related cognitive control predict daily coping with stress,"This study tested the hypothesis that individual differences in cognitive control can predict individual differences in emotion regulation. Participants completed color–word and emotional Stroop tasks while an electroencephalogram was recorded, and then they reported daily stressful events, affect, and coping for 14 days. Greater posterror slowing in the emotional Stroop task predicted greater negative affect in response to stressors and less use of task-focused coping as daily stressors increased. Participants whose neural activity best distinguished errors from correct responses tended to show less stress reactivity in daily self-reports. Finally, depression levels predicted daily affect and coping independent of cognitive control variables. The results offer qualified support for an integrated conception of cognitive and emotional self-regulation. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/70,,,,,,,,,,,
Dense Molecular Gas: A Sensitive Probe of Stellar Feedback Models,"We show that the mass fraction of giant molecular cloud (GMC) gas (n ≳ 100 cm−3) in dense (n ≫ 104 cm−3) star-forming clumps, observable in dense molecular tracers (LHCN/LCO(1–0)), is a sensitive probe of the strength and mechanism(s) of stellar feedback, as well as the star formation efficiencies in the most dense gas. Using high-resolution galaxy-scale simulations with pc-scale resolution and explicit models for feedback from radiation pressure, photoionization heating, stellar winds and supernovae (SNe), we make predictions for the dense molecular gas tracers as a function of GMC and galaxy properties and the efficiency of stellar feedback/star formation. In models with weak/no feedback, much of the mass in GMCs collapses into dense subunits, predicting LHCN/LCO(1–0) ratios order-of-magnitude larger than observed. By contrast, models with feedback properties taken directly from stellar evolution calculations predict dense gas tracers in good agreement with observations. Changing the strength or timing of SNe tends to move systems along, rather than off, the LHCN–LCO relation (because SNe heat lower density material, not the high-density gas). Changing the strength of radiation pressure (which acts efficiently in the highest density gas), however, has a much stronger effect on LHCN than on LCO. We show that degeneracies between the strength of feedback, and efficiency of star formation on small scales, can be broken by the combination of dense gas, intermediate-density gas and total star formation rate (SFR) tracers, and favour models where the galaxy-integrated star formation efficiency in dense gas is low. We also predict that the fraction of dense gas (LHCN/LCO(1–0)) increases with increasing GMC surface density; this drives a trend in LHCN/LCO(1–0) with SFR and luminosity which has tentatively been observed. Our results make specific predictions for enhancements in the dense gas tracers in unusually dense environments such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies and galactic nuclei (including the galactic centre).",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/328,,,,,,,,,,,

Restriction of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-1 to the Peptidergic Subset of Primary Afferent Neurons Follows its Developmental Downregulation in Nonpeptidergic Neurons,"Primary afferent ""pain"" fibers (nociceptors) are divided into subclasses based on distinct molecular and anatomical features, and these classes mediate noxious modality-specific contributions to behaviors evoked by painful stimuli. Whether the heat and capsaicin receptor transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) is expressed heterogeneously across several sensory populations, or is selectively expressed by a unique nociceptor subclass, however, is unclear. Here we used two lines of Trpv1 reporter mice to investigate the primary afferent expression of TRPV1, both during development and in the adult. We demonstrate, using Cre-induced lineage tracing, that during development TRPV1 is transiently expressed in a wide range of dorsal root ganglion neurons, and that its expression is gradually refined, such that TRPV1 transcripts become restricted to a specific subset of peptidergic sensory neurons. Finally, the remarkable sensitivity that is characteristic of these reporter mice revealed an innervation of central and peripheral targets by TRPV1+ primary afferents in the adult that is considerably more extensive than has previously been appreciated.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/340,,,,,,,,,,,
Inactivation of Conserved C. elegans Genes Engages Pathogen- and Xenobiotic-Associated Defenses,"The nematode C. elegans is attracted to nutritious bacteria and is repelled by pathogens and toxins. Here we show that RNAi and toxin-mediated disruption of core cellular activities, including translation, respiration, and protein turnover, stimulate behavioral avoidance of normally attractive bacteria. RNAi of these and other essential processes induces expression of detoxification and innate immune effectors, even in the absence of toxins or pathogens. Disruption of core processes in non-neuronal tissues was sufficient to stimulate aversion behavior, revealing a neuroendocrine axis of control that additionally required serotonergic and Jnk kinase signaling pathways. We propose that surveillance pathways overseeing core cellular activities allow animals to detect invading pathogens that deploy toxins and virulence factors to undermine vital host functions. Variation in cellular surveillance and endocrine pathways controlling behavior, detoxification, and immunity selected by past toxin or microbial interactions could underlie aberrant responses to foods, medicines, and microbes.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/507,,,,,,,,,,,
Trpv1 reporter mice reveal highly restricted brain distribution and functional expression in arteriolar smooth muscle cells,"The heat and capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, is required for the detection of painful heat by primary afferent pain fibers (nociceptors), but the extent to which functional TRPV1 channels are expressed in the CNS is debated. Because previous evidence is based primarily on indirect physiological responses to capsaicin, here we genetically modified the Trpv1 locus to reveal, with excellent sensitivity and specificity, the distribution of TRPV1 in all neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. In contrast to reports of widespread and robust expression in the CNS, we find that neuronal TRPV1 is primarily restricted to nociceptors in primary sensory ganglia, with minimal expression in a few discrete brain regions, most notably in a contiguous band of cells within and adjacent to the caudal hypothalamus. We confirm hypothalamic expression in the mouse using several complementary approaches, including in situ hybridization, calcium imaging, and electrophysiological recordings. Additional in situ hybridization experiments in rat, monkey, and human brain demonstrate that the restricted expression of TRPV1 in the CNS is conserved across species. Outside of the CNS, we find TRPV1 expression in a subset of arteriolar smooth muscle cells within thermoregulatory tissues. Here, capsaicin increases calcium uptake and induces vasoconstriction, an effect that likely counteracts the vasodilation produced by activation of neuronal TRPV1.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/339,,,,,,,,,,,
Cognitive control in the inter-trial interval: Evidence from EEG alpha power,"This study used electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum analyses to characterize neural activity during the intertrial interval, a period during which online cognitive adjustments in response to errors or conflict are thought to occur. EEG alpha power was quantified as an inverse index of cerebral activity during the period between each response and the next stimulus in a Stroop task. Alpha power was significantly reduced following error responses compared to correct responses, indicating greater cerebral activity following errors. Reduced alpha power was also observed following Stroop conflict trials compared to no-conflict trials, suggesting that conflict engages processes of mental adjustment. Finally, hemispheric differences in alpha power during the intertrial interval supported the complementary roles of the left and right hemispheres in behavioral activation and inhibition. --Journal Abstract",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/67,,,,,,,,,,,
The SLUGGS Survey: Kinematics for over 2500 Globular Clusters in Twelve Early-type Galaxies,"We present a spectrophotometric survey of 2522 extragalactic globular clusters (GCs) around 12 early-type galaxies, nine of which have not been published previously. Combining space-based and multicolour wide-field ground-based imaging, with spectra from the Keck/DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) instrument, we obtain an average of 160 GC radial velocities per galaxy, with a high-velocity precision of ∼15 km s−1per GC. After studying the photometric properties of the GC systems, such as their spatial and colour distributions, we focus on the kinematics of metal-poor (blue) and metal-rich (red) GC subpopulations to an average distance of ∼8 effective radii from the galaxy centre.  Our results show that for some systems the bimodality in GC colour is also present in GC kinematics. The kinematics of the red GC subpopulations are strongly coupled with the host galaxy stellar kinematics. The blue GC subpopulations are more dominated by random motions, especially in the outer regions, and decoupled from the red GCs. Peculiar GC kinematic profiles are seen in some galaxies: the blue GCs in NGC 821 rotate along the galaxy minor axis, whereas the GC system of the lenticular galaxy NGC 7457 appears to be strongly rotation supported in the outer region.  We supplement our galaxy sample with data from the literature and carry out a number of tests to study the kinematic differences between the two GC subpopulations. We confirm that the GC kinematics are coupled with the host galaxy properties and find that the velocity kurtosis and the slope of their velocity dispersion profiles are different between the two GC subpopulations in more massive galaxies.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/377,,,,,,,,,,,

Radio Bursts with Extragalactic Spectral Characteristics Show Terrestrial Origins,"Three years ago, the report of a solitary radio burst was thought to be the first discovery of a rare, impulsive event of unknown extragalactic origin. The extragalactic interpretation was based on the swept-frequency nature of the event, which followed the dispersive delay expected from an extragalactic pulse. We report here on the detection of 16 pulses, the bulk of which exhibit a frequency sweep with a shape and magnitude resembling the Lorimer Burst. These new events were detected in a sidelobe of the Parkes Telescope and are of clearly terrestrial origin, with properties unlike any known sources of terrestrial broadband radio emission. The new detections cast doubt on the extragalactic interpretation of the original burst, and call for further sophistication in radio-pulse survey techniques to identify the origin of the anomalous terrestrial signals and definitively distinguish future extragalactic pulse detections from local signals. The ambiguous origin of these seemingly dispersed, swept-frequency signals suggests that radio-pulse searches using multiple detectors will be the only experiments able to provide definitive information about the origin of new swept-frequency radio burst detections.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/389,,,,,,,,,,,
Jet energy measurement with the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at s√=7 TeV,"The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 inverse pb. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm with distance parameters R=0.4 or R=0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta pt > 20 GeV and pseudorapidities eta<4.5. The JES systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams. The JES uncertainty is less than 2.5% in the central calorimeter region (eta<0.8) for jets with 60 < pt < 800 GeV, and is maximally 14% for pt < 30 GeV in the most forward region 3.2",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/349,,,,,,,,,,,
The Infrared Light Curve of SN 2011fe in M101 and the Distance to M101,"We present near-infrared light curves of supernova (SN) 2011fe in M101, including 34 epochs in H band starting 14 days before maximum brightness in the B band. The light curve data were obtained with the WIYN High-Resolution Infrared Camera. When the data are calibrated using templates of other Type Ia SNe, we derive an apparent H-band magnitude at the epoch ofB-band maximum of 10.85 ± 0.04. This implies a distance modulus for M101 that ranges from 28.86 to 29.17 mag, depending on which absolute calibration for Type Ia SNe is used.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/379,,,,,,,,,,,
Preverbal error-monitoring in stutterers and fluent speakers,"This study was designed to characterize the brain system that monitors speech in people who stutter and matched controls. We measured two electrophysiological peaks associated with action-monitoring: the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe). Both the ERN and Pe were reliably observed after errors in a rhyming task and a nonverbal flanker task, replicating previous reports of a language-monitoring ERN and demonstrating that the Pe can also be elicited by phonological errors. In the rhyming task, stutterers showed a heightened ERN peak regardless of whether they actually committed an error. Similar results, though only marginally significant, were obtained from the flanker task. These results support the vicious cycle hypothesis, which posits that stuttering results from over-monitoring the speech plan. The elevation of the ERN in stutterers and the similarity of the results between the flanker and rhyming tasks implies that speech-monitoring may rely on the same neural substrate as action-monitoring.

The Meaning and Consequences of Star Formation Criteria in Galaxy Models with Resolved Stellar Feedback,"We consider the effects of different criteria for determining where stars will form in gas on galactic scales, in simulations with high (1 pc) resolution, with explicitly resolved physics of Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) formation and destruction, and stellar feedback from supernovae, radiation pressure, stellar winds and photoheating. We compare: (1) a self-gravity criterion (based on the local virial parameter and the assumption that self-gravitating gas collapses to high density in a single free-fall time), (2) a fixed density threshold, (3) a molecular-gas law, (4) a temperature threshold, (5) a requirement that the gas be Jeans unstable, (6) a criteria that cooling times be shorter than dynamical times and (7) a convergent-flow criterion. We consider all of these in both a Milky Way (MW)-like and high-density (starburst or high-redshift) galaxy. With feedback present, all models produce identical integrated star formation rates (SFRs), in good agreement with the Kennicutt relation; without feedback all produce orders-of-magnitude excessive SFRs. This is totally dependent on feedback and independent of the star formation (SF) law, even if the ‘local’ collapse efficiency is 100 per cent. However, the predicted spatial and density distribution depend strongly on the SF criteria. Because cooling rates are generally fast within galaxy discs, and gas is turbulent, criteria (4)–(7) are very ‘weak’ and spread the SF uniformly over most of the disc (down to densities n ∼ 0.01–0.1 cm−3). A molecular criterion (3) localizes to slightly higher densities, but still a wide range; for metallicity near solar, it is almost identical to a fixed density threshold at n ∼ 1 cm−3 (well below the mean density in the central MW or starburst systems). A fixed density threshold (2) can always select the highest resolved densities, but must be adjusted both for simulation resolution and individual galaxy properties – the same threshold that works well in a MW-like simulation will select nearly all gas in a starburst. Binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively select the largest local overdensities, independent of galaxy model or resolution, and automatically predict clustered SF. We argue that this SF model (possible with other secondary criteria) is most physically motivated and presents significant numerical advantages in simulations with a large dynamic range.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/327,,,,,,,,,,,

Herschel-ATLAS: A Binary HyLIRG Pinpointing a Cluster of Starbursting Protoellipticals,"Panchromatic observations of the best candidate hyperluminous infrared galaxies from the widest Herschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at least four intrinsically luminous z = 2.41 galaxies across an 100 kpc region—a cluster of starbursting protoellipticals. Via subarcsecond interferometric imaging we have measured accurate gas and star formation surface densities. The two brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc FWHM in submillimeter/radio continuum and CO J = 4-3, and double that in CO J = 1-0. The broad CO line is due partly to the multitude of constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in two counter-rotating gas disks—a scenario predicted to lead to the most intense starbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. The disks have M dyn of several × 1011 M ☉, and gas fractions of ~40%. Velocity dispersions are modest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with their radii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, not confined to their nuclei, at close to the Eddington limit. Their specific star formation rates place them  5 × above the main sequence, which supposedly comprises large gas disks like these. Their high star formation efficiencies are difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star formation law. N-body and dark matter simulations suggest that this system is the progenitor of a B(inary)-type 1014.6-M ☉ cluster.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/347,,,,,,,,,,,

A Search for Rapidly Spinning Pulsars and Fast Transients in Unidentified Radio Sources with the NRAO 43 Meter Telescope,"We have searched 75 unidentified radio sources selected from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey catalog for the presence of rapidly spinning pulsars and short, dispersed radio bursts. The sources are radio bright, have no identifications or optical source coincidences, are more than 5% linearly polarized, and are spatially unresolved in the catalog. If these sources are fast-spinning pulsars (e.g., sub-millisecond pulsars), previous large-scale pulsar surveys may have missed detection due to instrumental and computational limitations, eclipsing effects, or diffractive scintillation. The discovery of a sub-millisecond pulsar would significantly constrain the neutron star equation of state and would have implications for models predicting a rapid slowdown of highly recycled X-ray pulsars to millisecond periods from, e.g., accretion disk decoupling. These same sources were previously searched unsuccessfully for pulsations at 610 MHz with the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank. This new search was conducted at a different epoch with a new 800 MHz backend on the NRAO 43 m Telescope at a center frequency of 1200 MHz. Our search was sensitive to sub-millisecond pulsars in highly accelerated binary systems and to short transient pulses. No periodic or transient signals were detected from any of the target sources. We conclude that diffractive scintillation, dispersive smearing, and binary acceleration are unlikely to have prevented detection of the large majority of the sources if they are pulsars, though we cannot rule out eclipsing, nulling or intermittent emission, or radio interference as possible factors for some non-detections. Other (speculative) possibilities for what these sources might include radio-emitting magnetic cataclysmic variables or older pulsars with aligned magnetic and spin axes.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/378,,,,,,,,,,,
Eight New Radio Pulsars in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"We present the discovery of eight new radio pulsars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Five of these pulsars were found from reprocessing the Parkes Multibeam Survey of the Magellanic Clouds, while the remaining three were from an ongoing new survey at Parkes with a high-resolution data acquisition system. It is possible that these pulsars were missed in the earlier processing due to radio frequency interference, visual judgment or the large number of candidates that must be analysed. One of these new pulsars has a dispersion measure of 273 pc cm−3, almost twice the highest previously known value, making it possibly the most distant LMC pulsar. In addition, we present the null result of a radio pulse search of an X-ray point source located in SNR J0047.2−7308 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Although no millisecond pulsars have been found, these discoveries have increased the known rotation-powered pulsar population in the LMC by more than 50 per cent. Using the current sample of LMC pulsars, we used a Bayesian analysis to constrain the number of potentially observable pulsars in the LMC to within a 95 per cent credible interval of 57 000+70000−30000. The new survey at Parkes is ∼20 per cent complete, and it is expected to yield at most six millisecond pulsars in the LMC and SMC. Although it is very sensitive to short period pulsars, this new survey provides only a marginal increase in sensitivity to long periods. The limiting luminosity for this survey is 125 mJy kpc2 for the LMC which covers the upper 10 per cent of all known radio pulsars. The luminosity function for normal pulsars in the LMC is consistent with their counterparts in the Galactic disc. The maximum 1400 MHz radio luminosity for LMC pulsars is ∼1000 mJy kpc2.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/380,,,,,,,,,,,

Bounds on Dark Matter Properties from Radio  Observations of Ursa Major II using the Green Bank Telescope,"Radio observations of the Ursa Major II dwarf spheroidal galaxy obtained using the Green Bank Telescope are used to place bounds on weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter properties. Dark matter annihilation releases energy in the form of charged particles which emit synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field of the dwarf galaxy. We compute the expected synchrotron radiation intensity from WIMP annihilation to various primary channels. The predicted synchrotron radiation is sensitive to the distribution of dark matter in the halo, the diffusion coefficient D0, the magnetic field strength B, the particle mass mχ, the annihilation rate ⟨σav⟩, and the annihilation channel. Limits on ⟨σav⟩, mχ, B, and D0 are obtained for the e+e−, μ+μ−, τ+τ−, and bb¯ channels. Constraints on these parameters are sensitive to uncertainties in the measurement of the dark matter density profile. For the best fit halo parameters derived from stellar kinematics, we exclude 10 GeV WIMPs annihilating directly to e+e− at the thermal rate ⟨σav⟩=2.18×10−26  cm3/s at the 2σ level, for B>0.6  μG (1.6  μG) and D0=0.1(1.0)× the Milky Way diffusion value.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/355,,,,,,,,,,,

The GAPS Experiment: Hunting for Dark Matter with Antideuterons,"The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) experiment is an indirect dark matter search that aims to detect low-energy antideuterons resulting from dark matter annihilations in the galactic halo. This signature, which has negligible conventional astrophysical background, is predicted by many models of both supersymmetry and extra-dimensional theories. Until now, an optimized low-energy search experiment has been lacking. In this contribution, the scientific and experimental case for GAPS will be reviewed, and its complementarity with existing indirect and direct search experiments will be discussed. We will describe the design of GAPS, which consists of a time-of-flight system and layers of Si(Li) detectors in a tracking geometry designed specifically for low-energy antideuteron detection. The results of our successful prototype balloon flight (pGAPS), which flew from Japan in June 2012 and met 100% of its mission goals, as well as the path forward to a science flight of GAPS from Antarctica, will be presented.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/353,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 Spectroscopic M Dwarf Catalog. II. Statistical Parallax Analysis,"We present a statistical parallax analysis of low-mass dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculate absolute r-band magnitudes (Mr ) as a function of color and spectral type and investigate changes in Mr with location in the Milky Way. We find that magnetically active M dwarfs are intrinsically brighter in Mr than their inactive counterparts at the same color or spectral type. Metallicity, as traced by the proxy ζ, also affects Mr , with metal-poor stars having fainter absolute magnitudes than higher metallicity M dwarfs at the same color or spectral type. Additionally, we measure the velocity ellipsoid and solar reflex motion for each subsample of M dwarfs. We find good agreement between our measured solar peculiar motion and previous results for similar populations, as well as some evidence for differing motions of early and late M-type populations in U and W velocities that cannot be attributed to asymmetric drift. The reflex solar motion and the velocity dispersions both show that younger populations, as traced by magnetic activity and location near the Galactic plane, have experienced less dynamical heating. We introduce a new parameter, the independent position altitude (IPA), to investigate populations as a function of vertical height from the Galactic plane. M dwarfs at all types exhibit an increase in velocity dispersion when analyzed in comparable IPA subgroups.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/371,,,,,,,,,,,

This corresponds to a mass of ~10-30  and an age of 1-5 Gyr, however, there are large discrepancies between the model and observed spectrum. The radial and rotational velocities of the brown dwarf are measured as 46.9 ± 2.5 and 40 ± 10 km s–1, respectively, reflecting a thin disk Galactic orbit and fast rotation similar to other T dwarfs, suggesting a young, possibly planetary-mass brown dwarf.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/370,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagrammatic reasoning in Frege's Begriffsschrift,"In Part III of his 1879 logic Frege proves a theorem in the theory of sequences on the basis of four definitions. He claims in Grundlagen that this proof, despite being strictly deductive, constitutes a real extension of our knowledge, that it is ampliative rather than merely explicative. Frege furthermore connects this idea of ampliative deductive proof to what he thinks of as a fruitful definition, one that draws new lines. My aim is to show that we can make good sense of these claims if we read Frege's notation diagrammatically, in particular, if we take that notation to have been designed to enable one to exhibit the (inferentially articulated) contents of concepts in a way that allows one to reason deductively on the basis of those contents. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/philosophy_facpubs/105,,,,,,,,,,,

"Galaxy, Defined","A growing number of low luminosity and low surface brightness astronomical objects challenge traditional notions of both galaxies and star clusters. To address this challenge, we propose a definition of galaxy that does not depend on a cold dark matter model of the universe: a galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars whose properties cannot be explained by a combination of baryons and Newton's laws of gravity. After exploring several possible observational diagnostics of this definition, we critically examine the classification of ultra-faint dwarfs, globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and tidal dwarfs. While kinematic studies provide an effective diagnostic of the definition in many regimes, they can be less useful for compact or very faint systems. To explore the utility of using the [Fe/H] spread as a complementary diagnostic, we use published spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of 16 Milky Way dwarfs and 24 globular clusters to uniformly calculate their [Fe/H] spreads and associated uncertainties. Our principal results are (1) no known, old star cluster less luminous than M-V = -10 has a significant (greater than or similar to 0.1 dex) spread in its iron abundance; (2) known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies can be unambiguously classified with a combination of kinematic and [Fe/H] observations; (3) the observed [Fe/H] spreads in massive (greater than or similar to 10(6) M-circle dot) globular clusters do not necessarily imply that they are the stripped nuclei of dwarfs, nor a need for dark matter; and (4) if ultra-compact dwarf galaxies reside in dark matter halos akin to those of ultra-faint dwarfs of the same half-light radii, then they will show no clear dynamical signature of dark matter. We suggest several measurements that may assist the future classification of massive globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and ultra-faint galaxies. Our galaxy definition is designed to be independent of the details of current observations and models, while our proposed diagnostics can be refined or replaced as our understanding of the universe evolves. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/242,,,,,,,,,,,

Social deviance activates the brain's error-monitoring system,"Social psychologists have long noted the tendency for human behavior to conform to social group norms. This study examined whether feedback indicating that participants had deviated from group norms would elicit a neural signal previously shown to be elicited by errors and monetary losses. While electroencephalograms were recorded, participants (N = 30) rated the attractiveness of 120 faces and received feedback giving the purported average rating made by a group of peers. The feedback was manipulated so that group ratings either were the same as a participant's rating or deviated by 1, 2, or 3 points. Feedback indicating deviance from the group norm elicited a feedback-related negativity, a brainwave signal known to be elicited by objective performance errors and losses. The results imply that the brain treats deviance from social norms as an error. -- author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/68,,,,,,,,,,,

Inducing polarity in [VO3]nn- chain compounds using asymmetric hydrogen-bonding networks,One centrosymmetric and a pair of polar noncentrosymmetric templated metavanadates were synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. Asymmetry in the hydrogen-bonding between either [(R)-C5H14N2]2+ or [(S)-C5H14N2]2+ and [VO3]nn- chains results in polar structures that exhibit type 1 phase-matching capabilities. Hirshfeld surfaces were used to probe the hydrogen-bonding networks and component and net dipole moments were calculated from atomic positions and iterative-Hirshfeld partial charges. --author-supplied description,https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/226,,,,,,,,,,,

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: High-Resolution Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array Observations of Act Sze-Selected Clusters from the Equatorial Strip,"We present follow-up observations with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA) of optically confirmed galaxy clusters found in the equatorial survey region of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT): ACT-CL J0022-0036, ACT-CL J2051+0057, and ACT-CL J2337+0016. ACT-CL J0022-0036 is a newly discovered, massive (similar or equal to 10(15) M-circle dot), high-redshift (z = 0.81) cluster revealed by ACT through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). Deep, targeted observations with the SZA allow us to probe a broader range of cluster spatial scales, better disentangle cluster decrements from radio point-source emission, and derive more robust integrated SZE flux and mass estimates than we can with ACT data alone. For the two clusters we detect with the SZA we compute integrated SZE signal and derive masses from the SZA data only. ACT-CL J2337+ 0016, also known as A2631, has archival Chandra data that allow an additional X-ray-based mass estimate. Optical richness is also used to estimate cluster masses and shows good agreement with the SZE and X-ray-based estimates. Based on the point sources detected by the SZA in these three cluster fields and an extrapolation to ACT's frequency, we estimate that point sources could be contaminating the SZE decrement at the less than or similar to 20% level for some fraction of clusters.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/209,,,,,,,,,,,

Measurement of inclusive jet and dijet production in pp collisions at √ s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector,"Inclusive jet and dijet cross sections have been measured in proton-proton collisions at a centreof-mass energy of 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The cross sections were measured using jets clustered with the anti-kt algorithm with parameters R = 0.4 and R = 0.6. These measurements are based on the 2010 data sample, consisting of a total integrated luminosity of 37 pb−1 . Inclusive jet double-differential cross sections are presented as a function of jet transverse momentum, in bins of jet rapidity. Dijet double-differential cross sections are studied as a function of the dijet invariant mass, in bins of half the rapidity separation of the two leading jets. The measurements are performed in the jet rapidity range |y| < 4.4, covering jet transverse momenta from 20 GeV to 1.5 TeV and dijet invariant masses from 70 GeV to 5 TeV. The data are compared to expectations based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects, as well as to next-to-leading order Monte Carlo predictions. In addition to a test of the theory in a new kinematic regime, the data also provide sensitivity to parton distribution functions in a region where they are currently not well-constrained.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/348,,,,,,,,,,,

Cosmological Implications of a Stellar Initial Mass Function that Varies with the Jeans Mass in Galaxies,"Observations of star-forming galaxies at high z have suggested discrepancies in the inferred star formation rates (SFRs) either between data and models or between complementary measures of the SFR. These putative discrepancies could all be alleviated if the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is systematically weighted towards more high-mass star formation in rapidly star-forming galaxies. Here, we explore how the IMF might vary under the central assumption that the turnover mass in the IMF, , scales with the Jeans mass in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), . We employ hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies coupled with radiative transfer models to predict how the typical GMC Jeans mass, and hence the IMF, varies with galaxy properties. We then study the impact of such an IMF on the star formation law, the SFR–M* relation, sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) and the cosmic SFR density. Our main results are: the H2 mass-weighted Jeans mass in a galaxy scales well with the SFR when the SFR is greater than a few M⊙ yr−1. Stellar population synthesis modelling shows that this results in a non-linear relation between SFR and Lbol, such that SFR . Using this model relation, the inferred SFR of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies decreases by a factor of ∼2, and that of high-z SMGs decreases by a factor of ∼3–5. At z∼ 2, this results in a lowered normalization of the SFR–M* relation in better agreement with models, a reduced discrepancy between the observed cosmic SFR density and stellar mass density evolution, and SMG SFRs that are easier to accommodate in current hierarchical structure formation models. It further results in a Kennicutt–Schmidt star formation law with a slope of ∼1.6 when utilizing a physically motivated form for the CO–H2 conversion factor that varies with galaxy physical property. While each of the discrepancies considered here could be alleviated without appealing to a varying IMF, the modest variation implied by assuming  is a plausible solution that simultaneously addresses numerous thorny issues regarding the SFRs of high-z galaxies.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/331,,,,,,,,,,,
Galaxy Gas Fractions at High-Redshift: The Tension between Observations and Cosmological Simulations,"CO measurements of z ∼ 1–4 galaxies have found that their baryonic gas fractions are significantly higher than those for galaxies at z = 0, with values ranging from 20 to 80 per cent. Here, we suggest that the gas fractions inferred from observations of star-forming galaxies at high-z are overestimated, owing to the adoption of locally calibrated CO–H2conversion factors (αCO). Evidence from both observations and numerical models suggests that αCO varies smoothly with the physical properties of galaxies, and that αCO can be parametrized simply as a function of both gas-phase metallicity and observed CO surface brightness. When applying this functional form, we find fgas ≈ 10–40 per cent in galaxies with M* = 1010–1012  M⊙. Moreover, the scatter in the observed fgas–M* relation is lowered by a factor of 2. The lower inferred gas fractions arise physically because the interstellar media of high-z galaxies have higher velocity dispersions and gas temperatures than their local counterparts, which results in an αCO that is lower than the z = 0 value for both quiescent discs and starbursts. We further compare these gas fractions to those predicted by cosmological galaxy formation models. We show that while the canonically inferred gas fractions from observations are a factor of 2–3 larger at a given stellar mass than predicted by models, our rederived αCOvalues for z = 1–4 galaxies result in revised gas fractions that agree significantly better with the simulations.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/330,,,,,,,,,,,

Crossover distribution and frequency are regulated by him-5 in Caenorhabditis elegans,"Mutations in the him-5 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans strongly reduce the frequency of crossovers on the X chromosome, with lesser effects on the autosomes. him-5 mutants also show a change in crossover distribution on both the X and autosomes. These phenotypes are accompanied by a delayed entry into pachytene and premature desynapsis of the X chromosome. The nondisjunction, progression defects and desynapsis can be rescued by an exogenous source of double strand breaks (DSBs), indicating that the role of HIM-5 is to promote the formation of meiotic DSBs. Molecular cloning of the gene shows that the inferred HIM-5 product is a highly basic protein of 252 amino acids with no clear orthologs in other species, including other Caenorhabditis species. Although him-5 mutants are defective in segregation of the X chromosome, HIM-5 protein localizes preferentially to the autosomes. The mutant phenotypes and localization of him-5 are similar but not identical to the results seen with xnd-1, although unlike xnd-1, him-5 has no apparent effect on the acetylation of histone H2A on lysine 5 (H2AacK5). The localization of HIM-5 to the autosomes depends on the activities of both xnd-1 and him-17 allowing us to begin to establish pathways for the control of crossover distribution and frequency.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/281,,,,,,,,,,,

A General Model for the CO-H2 Conversion Factor in Galaxies with Applications to the Star  Formation Law,"The most common means of converting an observed CO line intensity into amolecular gas mass requires the use of a conversion factor (Xco). While in theMilky Way this quantity does not appear to vary significantly, there is goodreason to believe that Xco will depend on the larger-scale galacticenvironment. Utilising numerical models, we investigate how varyingmetallicities, gas temperatures and velocity dispersions in galaxies impact theway CO line emission traces the underlying H2 gas mass, and under whatcircumstances Xco may differ from the Galactic mean value. We find that, due tothe combined effects of increased gas temperature and velocity dispersion, Xcois depressed below the Galactic mean in high surface density environments suchas ULIRGs. In contrast, in low metallicity environments, Xco tends to be higherthan in the Milky Way, due to photodissociation of CO in metal-poor clouds. Athigher redshifts, gas-rich discs may have gravitationally unstable clumps whichare warm (due to increased star formation) and have elevated velocitydispersions. These discs tend to have Xco values ranging between present-epochgas-rich mergers and quiescent discs at low-z. This model shows that onaverage, mergers do have lower Xco values than disc galaxies, though there issignificant overlap. Xco varies smoothly with the local conditions within agalaxy, and is not a function of global galaxy morphology. We combine ourresults to provide a general fitting formula for Xco as a function of CO lineintensity and metallicity. We show that replacing the traditional approach ofusing one constant Xco for starbursts and another for discs with our best-fitfunction produces star formation laws that are continuous rather than bimodal,and that have significantly reduced scatter.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/326,,,,,,,,,,,

God vs. Westphalia: radical Islamist movements and the battle for organising the World,"This article presents the operation of al-Qaeda and Hizb ut-Tahrir, two of the most radical Islamist movements, through the lens of the relationship between religion as an organising principle for world politics and the state-based logic. It examines these groups in the context of repeated attempts by religious actors throughout history to render religion the dominant and constitutive element in world politics. Prior to the Peace of Westphalia, religion had a critical role in shaping the political landscape, but Westphalia relegated religion to a secondary position. While it accepted religion's role in the domestic affairs of the units in the international system, the Westphalian order kept religion subordinated to the logic of the state system. But religion maintained its ability to provide an alternative organisation for world politics. While al-Qaeda and Hizb ut-Tahrir are highly unlikely to bring about systemic change, their ascendance should remind scholars that the existing order is not inevitable and that the resurgence of religion in international politics also involves the resurrection of interpretations of religion that compete with and challenge the logic of the state-based system. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/polisci_facpubs/82,,,,,,,,,,,
Al Qaeda's Franchising Strategy,"In recent years al Qaeda established franchises throughout the Middle East. The establishment of formal branches, often through merger with jihadist groups, represents a political statement and, as such, goes beyond merely enhancing the group's operational capabilities. And yet, while its organizational expansion creates an image of success, this is hardly a true reflection of al Qaeda's reality. In fact, it reflects weakness and can be attributed to internal tension in the group's strategic thinking, conflict between its strategic objectives and organizational interests, the negative effects of its leadership's hubris, and an aggressive American campaign that puts severe constraints on al Qaeda's ability to operate. Thus, although al Qaeda still presents a severe threat, it is not as grave as the expansion of its brand name would suggest. Moreover, al Qaeda's franchising creates opportunities for more creative counterterrorism less reliant on military force. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/polisci_facpubs/71,,,,,,,,,,,
A two-year randomized trial of obesity treatment in primary care practice,"BACKGROUND
Calls for primary care providers (PCPs) to offer obese patients behavioral weight-loss counseling have not been accompanied by adequate guidance on how such care could be delivered. This randomized trial compared weight loss during a 2-year period in response to three lifestyle interventions, all delivered by PCPs in collaboration with auxiliary health professionals (lifestyle coaches) in their practices.   METHODS
We randomly assigned 390 obese adults in six primary care practices to one of three types of intervention: usual care, consisting of quarterly PCP visits that included education about weight management; brief lifestyle counseling, consisting of quarterly PCP visits combined with brief monthly sessions with lifestyle coaches who instructed participants about behavioral weight control; or enhanced brief lifestyle counseling, which provided the same care as described for the previous intervention but included meal replacements or weight-loss medication (orlistat or sibutramine), chosen by the participants in consultation with the PCPs, to potentially increase weight loss.   RESULTS
Of the 390 participants, 86% completed the 2-year trial, at which time, the mean (±SE) weight loss with usual care, brief lifestyle counseling, and enhanced brief lifestyle counseling was 1.7±0.7, 2.9±0.7, and 4.6±0.7 kg, respectively. Initial weight decreased at least 5% in 21.5%, 26.0%, and 34.9% of the participants in the three groups, respectively. Enhanced lifestyle counseling was superior to usual care on both these measures of success (P=0.003 and P=0.02, respectively), with no other significant differences among the groups. The benefits of enhanced lifestyle counseling remained even after participants given sibutramine were excluded from the analyses. There were no significant differences between the intervention groups in the occurrence of serious adverse events.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/321,,,,,,,,,,,

Predicting organic thin-film transistor carrier type from single molecule calculations,"The hole- or electron-conducting ability of functionalized acene-derivative organic molecular semiconductor thin-films can be predicted by electrochemical measurements of the frontier molecular orbital energies. We find that PM6 calculations using a Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Model (CPCM) solvent are in complete qualitative agreement with the electrochemical results, and B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) CPCM calculations are in quantitative agreement with the electrochemical results, given a suitable linear scaling function presented in this paper. These calculated electrochemical results can thus be used to predict the charge-carrier type of the resulting thin-film organic semiconductor device, enabling rapid computational screening of new materials. We also examine the role of internal reorganization energy and dielectric medium shifts to modify carrier conduction. Neither effect is large enough to explain the experimental results, demonstrating the importance of the relative orientations and packing of the molecules in the thin-film. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/223,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rictor/TORC2 Regulates Fat Metabolism, Feeding, Growth and Life Span in C. elegans","Rictor is a component of the target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2). While TORC2 has been implicated in insulin and other growth factor signaling pathways, the key inputs and outputs of this kinase complex remain unknown. We identified mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of rictor in a forward genetic screen for increased body fat. Despite high body fat, rictor mutants are developmentally delayed, small in body size, lay an attenuated brood, and are short-lived, indicating that Rictor plays a critical role in appropriately partitioning calories between long-term energy stores and vital organismal processes. Rictor is also necessary to maintain normal feeding on nutrient-rich food sources. In contrast to wild-type animals, which grow more rapidly on nutrient-rich bacterial strains, rictor mutants display even slower growth, a further reduced body size, decreased energy expenditure, and a dramatically extended life span, apparently through inappropriate, decreased consumption of nutrient-rich food. Rictor acts directly in the intestine to regulate fat mass and whole-animal growth. Further, the high-fat phenotype of rictor mutants is genetically dependent on akt-1, akt-2, and serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase-1 (sgk-1). Alternatively, the life span, growth, and reproductive phenotypes of rictor mutants are mediated predominantly by sgk-1. These data indicate that Rictor/TORC2 is a nutrient-sensitive complex with outputs to AKT and SGK to modulate the assessment of food quality and signal to fat metabolism, growth, feeding behavior, reproduction, and life span.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/508,,,,,,,,,,,
The sonic screwdriver,"When samples of interest are small enough, even the relatively weak forces and torques associated with light can be sufficient for mechanical manipulation, can offer extraordinary position control, and can measure interactions with three orders of magnitude better resolution than atomic force microscopy. However, as the components of interest grow to slightly larger length scales (which may yet be of interest for microfluidic, ""lab-on-a-chip"" technologies and for research involving biomedical imaging), other approaches gain strength. This paper includes discussion of the angular momentum carried by sonic beams that we have implemented both to levitate and controllably rotate disks as large as four inches across. Discussion of such acoustic beams complements the discussion of the angular momentum carried by light and, by further analogy, how we view stationary states discussed in quantum mechanics. Hence, a primary use of the sonic screwdriver is as a model system, although these beams are useful for a variety of other reasons as well (not least for aberration correction for ultrasonic array systems). Methods, including the use of holographically structured fields, are discussed.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/617,,,,,,,,,,,

From computational discovery to experimental characterization of a high hole mobility organic crystal,"For organic semiconductors to find ubiquitous electronics applications, the development of new materials with high mobility and air stability is critical. Despite the versatility of carbon, exploratory chemical synthesis in the vast chemical space can be hindered by synthetic and characterization difficulties. Here we show that in silico screening of novel derivatives of the dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene semiconductor with high hole mobility and air stability can lead to the discovery of a new high-performance semiconductor. On the basis of estimates from the Marcus theory of charge transfer rates, we identified a novel compound expected to demonstrate a theoretic twofold improvement in mobility over the parent molecule. Synthetic and electrical characterization of the compound is reported with single-crystal field-effect transistors, showing a remarkable saturation and linear mobility of 12.3 and 16 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This is one of the very few organic semiconductors with mobility greater than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 reported to date.--author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/250,,,,,,,,,,,

Determination of the ATLAS jet energy measurement uncertainty using photon-jet events in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV,"The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 pb−1 . Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm with distance parameters R = 0.4 or R = 0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta pT ≥ 20 GeV and pseudorapidities |η| < 4.5. The JES systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams, exploiting the transverse momentum balance between central and forward jets in events with dijet topologies and studying systematic variations in Monte Carlo simulations. The JES uncertainty is less than 2.5% in the central calorimeter region (|η| < 0.8) for jets with 60 ≤ pT < 800 GeV, and is maximally 14% for pT < 30 GeV in the most forward region 3.2 ≤ |η| < 4.5. The uncertainty for additional energy from multiple proton-proton collisions in the same bunch crossing is less than 1.5% per additional collision for jets with pT > 50 GeV after a dedicated correction for this effect. The JES is validated for jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV to the level of a few percent using several in situ techniques by comparing a well-known reference such as the recoiling photon pT, the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated to the jet, or a system of low-pT jets recoiling against a high-pT jet. More sophisticated jet calibration schemes are presented based on calorimeter cell energy density weighting or hadronic properties of jets, providing an improved jet energy resolution and a reduced flavour dependence of the jet response. The JES systematic uncertainty determined from a combination of in situ techniques are consistent with the one derived from single hadron response measurements over a wide kinematic range. The nominal corrections and uncertainties are derived for isolated jets in an inclusive sample of high-pT jets. Special cases such as event topologies with close-by jets, or selections of samples with an enhanced content of jets originating from light quarks, heavy quarks or gluons are also discussed and the corresponding uncertainties are determined.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/347,,,,,,,,,,,

The Kennicutt-Schmidt Star Formation Relation at z~2,"Recent observations of excited CO emission lines from z∼ 2 disc galaxies have shed light on the SFR ∝ρN relation at high z via observed ΣSFR–ΣαCOJ=2−1 and ΣSFR–ΣαCOJ=3−2 relations. Here, we describe a novel methodology for utilizing these observations of high-excitation CO to derive the underlying Schmidt (SFR ∝ρN) relationship. To do this requires an understanding of the potential effects of differential CO excitation with SFR. If the most heavily star-forming galaxies have a larger fraction of their gas in highly excited CO states than the lower SFR galaxies, then the observed molecular Kennicutt–Schmidt index, α, will be less than the underlying SFR ∝ρN index, N. Utilizing a combination of SPH models of galaxy evolution and molecular line radiative transfer, we present the first calculations of CO excitation in z∼ 2 disc galaxies with the aim of developing a mapping between various observed ΣSFR–ΣαCO relationships and the underlying SFR ∝ρN relation. We find that even in relatively luminous z∼ 2 discs, differential excitation does indeed exist, resulting in α < N for highly excited CO lines. This means that an observed (e.g.) ΣSFR–ΣαCOJ=3−2 relation does not map linearly to a ΣSFR–ΣαH2 relation. We utilize our model results to provide a mapping from α to N for the range of Schmidt indices N= 1–2. By comparing to recent observational surveys, we find that the observed  and ΣSFR–ΣαCOJ=3−2 relations suggest that an underlying SFR ∝ρ1.5 relation describes z∼ 2 disc galaxies.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/334,,,,,,,,,,,

Combinatorial games with a pass: A dynamical systems approach,"By treating combinatorial games as dynamical systems, we are able to address a longstanding open question in combinatorial game theory, namely, how the introduction of a ""pass"" move into a game affects its behavior. We consider two well known combinatorial games, 3-pile Nim and 3-row Chomp. In the case of Nim, we observe that the introduction of the pass dramatically alters the game's underlying structure, rendering it considerably more complex, while for Chomp, the pass move is found to have relatively minimal impact. We show how these results can be understood by recasting these games as dynamical systems describable by dynamical recursion relations. From these recursion relations, we are able to identify underlying structural connections between these ""games with passes"" and a recently introduced class of ""generic (perturbed) games."" This connection, together with a (non-rigorous) numerical stability analysis, allows one to understand and predict the effect of a pass on a game.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/536,,,,,,,,,,,

It represents an extensive investigation involving four labs throughout the US and Canada (including mine!). It illustrates sex differences in neurochemical mediation of stress induced analgesia in humans and animals, and shows similarity in mechanism across species."" --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/195,,,,,,,,,,,
Al-Qaeda's Franchising Strategy,"In recent years al Qaeda established franchises throughout the Middle East. The establishment of formal branches, often through merger with jihadist groups, represents a political statement and, as such, goes beyond merely enhancing the group's operational capabilities. And yet, while its organizational expansion creates an image of success, this is hardly a true reflection of al Qaeda's reality. In fact, it reflects weakness and can be attributed to internal tension in the group's strategic thinking, conflict between its strategic objectives and organizational interests, the negative effects of its leadership's hubris, and an aggressive American campaign that puts severe constraints on al Qaeda's ability to operate. Thus, although al Qaeda still presents a severe threat, it is not as grave as the expansion of its brand name would suggest. Moreover, al Qaeda's franchising creates opportunities for more creative counterterrorism less reliant on military force. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/polisci_facpubs/79,,,,,,,,,,,

In it I discuss themes in Rorty and Plato's Theaetetus concerning truth and knowledge, and argue in particular that just as there are three quite different levels of discourse in the Theaetetus so we need to recognize that there are three analogous levels of discourse in Rorty's discussions of truth. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/philosophy_facpubs/103,,,,,,,,,,,

Colocalization of Sensors is Sufficient to Activate the DNA Damage Checkpoint in the Absence of Damage,"Previous work on the DNA damage checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that two complexes independently sense DNA lesions: the kinase Mec1-Ddc2 and the PCNA-like 9-1-1 complex. To test whether colocalization of these components is sufficient for checkpoint activation, we fused these checkpoint proteins to the LacI repressor and artificially colocalized these fusions by expressing them in cells harboring Lac operator arrays. We observed Rad53 and Rad9 phosphorylation, Sml1 degradation, and metaphase delay, demonstrating that colocalization of these sensors is sufficient to activate the checkpoint in the absence of DNA damage. Our tethering system allowed us to establish that CDK functions in the checkpoint pathway downstream of damage processing and checkpoint protein recruitment. This CDK dependence is likely, at least in part, through Rad9, since mutation of CDK consensus sites compromised its checkpoint function.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/509,,,,,,,,,,,

Constructing Stories of Self-Growth: How Individual Differences in Patterns of Autobiographical Reasoning Relate to Well-Being in Midlife,"This study involved an in-depth quantitative analysis of midlife adults' life stories, using 'causal connections' -- i.e., interpretations of how past events shape the growth of the self -- as the core unit of narrative analysis. We found that interpretations of self-growth predict well-being even after controlling for traits and demographic factors and that growth from negative events is more predictive of well-being than growth from positive events. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/124,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced Dense Gas Fraction in Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies,"We present a detailed analysis of the relation between infrared luminosity and molecular line luminosity, for a variety of molecular transitions, using a sample of 34 nearby galaxies spanning a broad range of infrared luminosities (1010 L ☉ < L IR < 1012.5 L ☉). We show that the power-law index of the relation is sensitive to the critical density of the molecular gas tracer used, and that the dominant driver in observed molecular line ratios in galaxies is the gas density. As most nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) exhibit strong signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in their center, we revisit previous claims questioning the reliability of HCN as a probe of the dense gas responsible for star formation in the presence of AGNs. We find that the enhanced HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) luminosity ratio observed in ULIRGs can be successfully reproduced using numerical models with fixed chemical abundances and without AGN-induced chemistry effects. We extend this analysis to a total of 10 molecular line ratios by combining the following transitions: CO(1-0), HCO+(1-0), HCO+(3-2), HCN(1-0), and HCN(3-2). Our results suggest that AGNs reside in systems with higher dense gas fraction, and that chemistry or other effects associated with their hard radiation field may not dominate (NGC 1068 is one exception). Galaxy merger could be the underlying cause of increased dense gas fraction, and the evolutionary stage of such mergers may be another determinant of the HCN/CO luminosity ratio.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/336,,,,,,,,,,,

The ATLAS Inner Detector commissioning and calibration,"The ATLAS Inner Detector is a composite tracking system consisting of silicon pixels, silicon strips and straw tubes in a 2 T magnetic field. Its installation was completed in August 2008 and the detector took part in data-taking with single LHC beams and cosmic rays. The initial detector operation, hardware commissioning and in-situ calibrations are described. Tracking performance has been measured with 7.6 million cosmic-ray events, collected using a tracking trigger and reconstructed with modular pattern-recognition and fitting software. The intrinsic hit efficiency and tracking trigger efficiencies are close to 100%. Lorentz angle measurements for both electrons and holes, specific energy-loss calibration and transition radiation turn-on measurements have been performed. Different alignment techniques have been used to reconstruct the detector geometry. After the initial alignment, a transverse impact parameter resolution of 22.1±0.9 μm and a relative momentum resolution σ p /p=(4.83±0.16)×10−4 GeV−1×p Thave been measured for high momentum tracks.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/345,,,,,,,,,,,

Jet energy scale and its systematic uncertainty for jets produced in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and measured with the ATLAS detector,"The first determination of the jet energy scale (JES) and the evaluation of its systematic uncertainty for inclusive jets measured in the ATLAS detector from proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV are described. The energy scale of jets measured in the ATLAS calorimeters is calibrated on average to the hadronic scale using a method based on a simulated Monte Carlo QCD jets sample. This Monte Carlo simulation has been validated with data collected by the ATLAS detector at sqrt(s) = 900 GeV and sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. The energy contribution of multiple proton-proton interactions to calorimeter jets is not accounted for in the current JES calibration; it is included as a separate contribution to the systematic uncertainty, and it is shown to contribute less than 2%. The JES systematic uncertainty is evaluated by comparing the nominal results to Monte Carlo simulations using alternative detector configurations, alternative hadronic shower and physics models, and by comparing the relative response of jets across pseudo-rapidity between data and simulation, using a total integrated luminosity of 7 nb-1. The calorimeter contribution to the JES uncertainty is verified with a method that propagates the uncertainties on the single energy deposits comprised in jets. This estimate is based on single particle studies, from in-situ and test beam measurements. For inclusive jets with transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV and pseudo-rapidity smaller than 2.8, the jet energy scale is determined with an uncertainty smaller than 10%.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/346,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lipid Raft Targeted Akt Promotes Axonal Branching and Growth Cone Expansion via mTOR and rac1, Respectively","The molecular mechanisms by which extracellular guidance cues regulate axonal morphology are not fully understood. Recent findings suggest that increased activity of the protein kinase Akt promotes dendritic branching and elongation in hippocampal neurons. We tested whether expression of constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt) in primary sensory neurons would promote axonal branching and whether targeting CA-Akt to lipid rafts, common sites of Akt function, would differentially regulate axonal morphology. Biolistic transduction of sensory neurons induced a rapid expression of CA-Akt, resulting in increased axonal branching, cell hypertrophy, and growth cone expansion. Additionally, we found that targeting of CA-Akt to lipid rafts significantly potentiated growth cone expansion compared with expression of CA-Akt throughout the neuron. Because lipid rafts are concentrated within the growth cone, this finding suggests that signaling of expansion is likely regulated locally. We found that CA-Akt-mediated growth cone expansion, but not axonal branching, was attenuated by coexpression of dominant-negative Rac1. In contrast, blockade of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) prevented axonal branching and hypertrophy in response to CA-Akt, but not growth cone expansion. These data indicate that Akt activity can regulate growth cone expansion via localized Rac1 signaling and regulate axonal branching and soma size via activation of mTOR.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/503,,,,,,,,,,,

The Formation of High-Redshift Submillimetre Galaxies,"We describe a model for the formation of z∼ 2 submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) which simultaneously accounts for both average and bright SMGs while providing a reasonable match to their mean observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs). By coupling hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers with the high-resolution 3D polychromatic radiative transfer code SUNRISE, we find that a mass sequence of merger models which use observational constraints as physical input naturally yield objects which exhibit black hole, bulge and H2 gas masses similar to those observed in SMGs. The dominant drivers behind the 850 μm flux are the masses of the merging galaxies and the stellar birth cloud covering fraction. The most luminous (S850≳ 15 mJy) sources are recovered by ∼1013 M⊙ 1:1 major mergers with a birth cloud covering fraction close to unity, whereas more average SMGs (S850∼ 5–7 mJy) may be formed in lower mass haloes (∼5 × 1012 M⊙). These models demonstrate the need for high spatial resolution hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations in matching both the most luminous sources as well as the full SEDs of SMGs. While these models suggest a natural formation mechanism for SMGs, they do not attempt to match cosmological statistics of galaxy populations; future efforts along this line will help ascertain the robustness of these models.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/325,,,,,,,,,,,

Turning the Tides on the  Ultra-Faint Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies: Coma Berenices and Ursa Major,"We present deep CFHT/MegaCam photometry of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxies: Coma Berenices (ComBer) and Ursa Major II (UMa II). These data extend to r ~ 25, corresponding to 3 mag below the main-sequence turn-offs in these galaxies. We robustly calculate a total luminosity of MV = –3.8 ± 0.6 for ComBer and MV = –3.9 ± 0.5 for UMa II, in agreement with previous results and confirming that these galaxies are among the faintest of the known dwarf satellites of the Milky Way. ComBer shows a fairly regular morphology with no signs of active tidal stripping down to a surface brightness limit of 32.4 mag arcsec–2. Using a maximum likelihood analysis, we calculate the half-light radius of ComBer to be r half = 74 ± 4 pc (5.8 ± 03) and its ellipticity = 0.36 ± 0.04. In contrast, UMa II shows signs of ongoing disruption. We map its morphology down to μ V = 32.6 mag arcsec–2 and found that UMa II is larger than previously determined, extending at least ~600 pc (11 on the sky) and it is also quite elongated with an overall ellipticity of = 0.50 ± 0.2. However, our estimate for the half-light radius, 123 ± 3 pc (14.1 ± 03) is similar to previous results. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of potential indirect dark matter detections and galaxy formation. We conclude that while ComBer appears to be a stable dwarf galaxy, UMa II shows signs of ongoing tidal interaction.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/357,,,,,,,,,,,

Arecibo Pulsar Survey Using ALFA: Probing Radio Pulsar Intermittency and Transients,"We present radio transient search algorithms, results, and statistics from the ongoing Arecibo Pulsar ALFA (PALFA) survey of the Galactic plane. We have discovered seven objects through a search for isolated dispersed pulses. All of these objects are Galactic and have measured periods between 0.4 and 4.7 s. One of the new discoveries has a duty cycle of 0.01%, smaller than that of any other radio pulsar. We discuss the impact of selection effects on the detectability and classification of intermittent sources, and compare the efficiencies of periodicity and single-pulse (SP) searches for various pulsar classes. For some cases we find that the apparent intermittency is likely to be caused by off-axis detection or a short time window that selects only a few bright pulses and favors detection with our SP algorithm. In other cases, the intermittency appears to be intrinsic to the source. No transients were found with DMs large enough to require that they originate from sources outside our Galaxy. Accounting for the on-axis gain of the ALFA system, as well as the low gain but large solid-angle coverage of far-out sidelobes, we use the results of the survey so far to place limits on the amplitudes and event rates of transients of arbitrary origin.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/386,,,,,,,,,,,

Upper Limits on Pulsed Radio Emission from the 6.85 s X-ray Pulsar XTE J0103-728 in the Small Magellanic Cloud,"X-ray pulsations with a 6.85 s period were recently detected in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and were subsequently identified as originating from the Be/X-ray binary system XTE J0103–728. The recent localization of the source of the X-ray emission has made a targeted search for radio pulsations from this source possible. The detection of pulsed radio emission from XTE J0103–728 would make it only the second system after PSR B1259–63 that is both a Be/X-ray binary and a radio pulsar. We observed XTE J0103–728 in 2008 February with the Parkes 64 m radio telescope soon after the identification of the source of X-ray pulsations was reported in order to search for corresponding radio pulsations. We used a continuous 6.4 hr observation with a 256 MHz bandwidth centered at 1390 MHz using the center beam of the Parkes multibeam receiver. In the subsequent data analysis, which included a folding search, a Fourier search, a fast-folding algorithm search, and a single pulse search, no pulsed signals were found for trial dispersion measures (DMs) between 0 and 800 pc cm–3. This DM range easily encompasses the expected values for sources in the SMC. We place an upper limit of ~45 mJy kpc2 on the luminosity of periodic radio emission from XTE J0103–728 at the epoch of our observation, and we compare this limit to a range of luminosities measured for PSR B1259–63, the only Be/X-ray binary currently known to emit radio pulses. We also compare our limit to the radio luminosities of neutron stars having similarly long spin periods to XTE J0103–728. Since the radio pulses from PSR B1259–63 are eclipsed and undetectable during the portion of the orbit near periastron, repeated additional radio search observations of XTE J0103–728 may be valuable if it is undergoing similar eclipsing and if such observations are able to sample the orbital phase of this system well.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/385,,,,,,,,,,,
Detecting the Cosmic Dipole Anisotropy in Large-Scale Radio Surveys,"The detection of a dipole anisotropy in the sky distribution of sources in large-scale radio surveys can be used to constrain the magnitude and direction of our local motion with respect to an isotropically distributed extragalactic radio source population. Such a population is predicted to be present at cosmological redshifts in an isotropically expanding universe. The extragalactic radio source population is observed to have a median redshift of z ~ 1, a much later epoch than the cosmic microwave background (z ~ 1100). I consider the detectability of a velocity dipole anisotropy in radio surveys having a finite number of source counts. The statistical significance of a velocity dipole detection from radio source counts is also discussed in detail. I find that existing large-scale radio survey catalogs do not have a sufficient number of sources to detect the expected velocity dipole with statistical significance, even if survey masking and flux calibration complications can be completely eliminated (i.e., if both the surveys and observing instruments are perfect). However, a dipole anisotropy should be easily detectable in future radio surveys planned with next-generation radio facilities, such as the Low Frequency Array and the Square Kilometer Array; tight constraints on the dipole magnitude and direction should be possible if flux calibration problems can be sufficiently minimized or corrected and contamination from local sources can be eliminated.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/384,,,,,,,,,,,

Radio Detection of LAT PSRs J1741-2054 and J2032+4127: No Longer Just Gamma-ray Pulsars,"Sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photons collected with the Large Area Telescope on theFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. PSR J1741-2054, with period P = 413 ms, was detected in archival Parkes telescope data and subsequently has been detected at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Its received flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has a very small dispersion measure of DM = 4.7 pc cm–3, implying a distance of 0.4 kpc and possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. At this distance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1 GeV corresponds to 28% of the spin-down luminosity of  erg s–1. The gamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely spaced peaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by δ = 0.29 P. We have also identified a soft Swift source that is the likely X-ray counterpart. In many respects PSR J1741-2054 resembles the Geminga pulsar. The second source, PSR J2032+4127, was detected at the GBT. It has P = 143 ms, and its DM = 115 pc cm–3 suggests a distance of 3.6 kpc, but we consider it likely that it is located within the Cyg OB2 stellar association at half that distance. The radio emission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes by δ = 0.15 P the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated by Δ = 0.50 P. The second peak has a harder spectrum than the first one, following a trend observed in young gamma-ray pulsars. Faint, diffuse X-ray emission in a Chandra image is possibly its pulsar wind nebula. The wind of PSR J2032+4127 is responsible for the formerly unidentified HEGRA source TeV J2032+4130. PSR J2032+4127 is coincident in projection with MT91 213, a Be star in Cyg OB2, although apparently not a binary companion of it.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/387,,,,,,,,,,,

The Nature of CO Emission from z~6 Quasars,"We investigate the nature of molecular gas emission from z ~ 6 quasars via the commonly observed tracer of H2, carbon monoxide (CO). We achieve this by combining non-LTE radiative transfer calculations with merger-driven models of z ~ 6 quasar formation that arise naturally in Λ cold dark matter structure formation simulations. Motivated by observational constraints, we consider four representative z ~ 6 quasars formed in the halo mass range ~1012-1013 M☉ from different merging histories. Our main results are as follows. We find that, owing to massive starbursts and funneling of dense gas into the nuclear regions of merging galaxies, the CO is highly excited during both the hierarchical buildup of the host galaxy and the quasar phase, and the CO flux density peaks between J = 5 and 8. The CO morphology of z ~ 6 quasars often exhibits multiple CO emission peaks which arise from molecular gas concentrations which have not yet fully coalesced. Both of these results are found to be consistent with the sole CO detection at z ~ 6, in quasar J1148+5251. Quasars which form at z ~ 6 display a large range of sight line-dependent line widths. The sight line dependencies are such that the narrowest line widths are when the rotating molecular gas associated with the quasar is viewed face-on (when the LB is largest) and broadest when the quasar is seen edge-on (and the LB is lowest). Thus, we find that for all models selection effects exist such that quasars selected for optical luminosity are preferentially seen to be face-on which may result in CO detections of optically luminous quasars at z ~ 6 having line widths narrower than the median. The mean sight line-averaged line width is found to be reflective of the circular velocity of the host halo and thus scales with halo mass. For example, the mean line width for the ~1012 M☉ halo is σ ~ 300 km s−1, while the median for the ~1013 M☉ quasar host is σ ~ 650 km s−1. Depending on the host halo mass, approximately 2%-10% of sight lines in our modeled quasars are found to have narrow line widths compatible with observations of J1148+5251. When considering the aforementioned selection effects, these percentages increase to 10%-25% for quasars selected for optical luminosity. When accounting for both temporal evolution of CO line widths in galaxies, as well as the redshift evolution of",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/341,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct subsets of unmyelinated primary sensory fibers mediate behavioral responses to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli,"Behavioral responses to painful stimuli require peripheral sensory neurons called nociceptors. Electrophysiological studies show that most C-fiber nociceptors are polymodal (i.e., respond to multiple noxious stimulus modalities, such as mechanical and thermal); nevertheless, these stimuli are perceived as distinct. Therefore, it is believed that discrimination among these modalities only occurs at spinal or supraspinal levels of processing. Here, we provide evidence to the contrary. Genetic ablation in adulthood of unmyelinated sensory neurons expressing the G protein-coupled receptor Mrgprd reduces behavioral sensitivity to noxious mechanical stimuli but not to heat or cold stimuli. Conversely, pharmacological ablation of the central branches of TRPV1(+) nociceptors, which constitute a nonoverlapping population, selectively abolishes noxious heat pain sensitivity. Combined elimination of both populations yielded an additive phenotype with no additional behavioral deficits, ruling out a redundant contribution of these populations to heat and mechanical pain sensitivity. This double-dissociation suggests that the brain can distinguish different noxious stimulus modalities from the earliest stages of sensory processing.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/345,,,,,,,,,,,
Nonlinear dynamics in combinatorial games: Renormalizing Chomp,"We develop a new approach to combinatorial games that reveals connections between such games and some of the central ideas of nonlinear dynamics: scaling behaviors, complex dynamics and chaos, universality, and aggregation processes. We take as our model system the combinatorial game Chomp, which is one of the simplest in a class of ""unsolved"" combinatorial games that includes Chess, Checkers, and Go. We discover that the game possesses an underlying geometric structure that ""grows"" (reminiscent of crystal growth), and show how this growth can be analyzed using a renormalization procedure adapted from physics. In effect, this methodology allows one to transform a combinatorial game like Chomp into a type of dynamical system. Not only does this provide powerful insights into the game of Chomp (yielding a complete probabilistic description of optimal play in Chomp and an answer to a longstanding question about the nature of the winning opening move), but more generally, it offers a mathematical framework for exploring this unexpected relationship between combinatorial games and modern dynamical systems theory.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/541,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular Star Formation Rate Indicators in Galaxies,"We derive a physical model for the observed relations between star formation rate (SFR) and molecular line (CO and HCN) emission in galaxies and show how these observed relations are reflective of the underlying star formation law. We do this by combining 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations with hydrodynamic simulations of isolated disk galaxies and galaxy mergers. We demonstrate that the observed SFR-molecular line relations are driven by the relationship between molecular line emission and gas density and anchored by the index of the underlying Schmidt law controlling the SFR in the galaxy. Lines with low critical densities (e.g., CO J = 1–0) are typically thermalized and trace the gas density faithfully. In these cases, the SFR will be related to line luminosity with an index similar to the Schmidt law index. Lines with high critical densities greater than the mean density of most of the emitting clouds in a galaxy (e.g., CO J = 3–2, HCN J = 1–0) will have only a small amount of thermalized gas and consequently a superlinear relationship between molecular line luminosity (Lmol) and mean gas density (). This results in an SFR-line luminosity index less than the Schmidt index for high critical density tracers. One observational consequence of this is a significant redistribution of light from the small pockets of dense, thermalized gas to diffuse gas along the line of sight, and prodigious emission from subthermally excited gas. At the highest star formation rates, the SFR-Lmol slope tends to the Schmidt index, regardless of the molecular transition. The fundamental relation is the Kennicutt-Schmidt law, rather than the relation between SFR and molecular line luminosity. Our model for SFR-molecular line relations quantitatively reproduces the slopes of the observed SFR-CO (J = 1–0), CO (J = 3–2), and HCN (J = 1–0) relations when a Schmidt law with index of ~1.5 describes the SFR. We use these results to make imminently testable predictions for the SFR-molecular line relations of unobserved transitions.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/339,,,,,,,,,,,

Flux Densities and Radio Polarization Characteristics of Two Vela-like Pulsars,"We report on dual-frequency radio polarimetry observations of two young, energetic pulsars, PSRs J0940-5428 and J1301-6305. These were among the first Vela-like pulsars discovered in the Parkes multibeam survey. We conducted observations of these pulsars with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at center frequencies of 1384 and 2496 MHz using pulsar gating while preserving full Stokes parameters. After correcting for bandwidth depolarization, we measured polarization characteristics, flux densities, and rotation measures for these pulsars. The spectral indices derived from the ATCA data are shallow but still consistent with values seen for pulsars of this type. The rotation measures for both pulsars are consistent with those reported recently using data from the Parkes telescope, and both pulsars have highly linearly polarized pulse profiles at both 1384 and 2496 MHz. Our results support a previously noted correlation between a high degree of linear polarization, shallow spectral index, and large spin-down luminosity.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/381,,,,,,,,,,,

Probing the Oligomeric State of Pea Porphobilinogen Synthase by Analytical Ultracentrifugation,"The enzyme porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) can exist in different non-additive homo-oligomeric assemblies and, under appropriate conditions, the distribution of these assemblies can respond to ligands such as metals or substrate. PBGS from most organisms was believed to be octameric until work on a rare allele of human PBGS revealed an alternate hexameric assembly, which is also available to the wild type enzyme at elevated pH. Herein, we establish that the distribution of pea PBGS quaternary structures also contains octamers and hexamers, using both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments. We report results in which the octamer dominates under purification conditions and discuss conditions that influence the octamer:hexamer ratio. As predicted by PBGS crystal structures from related organisms, in the absence of magnesium, the octameric assembly is significantly destabilized and the oligomeric distribution is dominated largely by the hexameric assembly. Although the PBGS hexamer-to-octamer oligomeric rearrangement is well document under some conditions, both assemblies are very stable (under AUC conditions) in the timeframe of our ultracentrifuge experiments.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/500,,,,,,,,,,,

The Star-Forming Molecular Gas in High-Redshift Submillimetre Galaxies,"We present a model for the CO molecular line emission from high-redshift Submillimetre Galaxies (SMGs). By combining hydrodynamic simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers with the polychromatic radiative transfer code,SUNRISE, and the 3D non-LTE molecular line radiative transfer code,TURTLEBEACH, we show that if SMGs are typically a transient phase of major mergers, then their observed compact CO spatial extents, broad linewidths and high excitation conditions (CO spectral energy distribution) are naturally explained. In this sense, SMGs can be understood as scaled-up analogues to local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULRIGs). We utilize these models to investigate the usage of CO as an indicator of physical conditions. We find that care must be taken when applying standard techniques. The usage of CO linewidths as a dynamical mass estimator from SMGs can possibly overestimate the true enclosed mass by a factor of ∼1.5–2. At the same time, assumptions of line ratios of unity from COJ= 3–2 (and higher lying lines) to CO (J= 1–0) will oftentimes lead to underestimates of the inferred gas mass. We provide tests for these models by outlining predictions for experiments which are imminently feasible with the current generation of bolometer arrays and radio-wave spectrometers.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/335,,,,,,,,,,,

The Star Formation Rate-Dense Gas Relation as Measured by HCN (J=3-2) Emission,We present observations made with the 10 m Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope of HCN(3-2) emission from a sample of 30 nearby galaxies ranging in infrared luminosity from 1010 to 1012.5 L☉ and HCN(3-2) luminosity from 106 to 109 K km s−1 pc2. We examine the correlation between the infrared luminosity and HCN(3-2) luminosity and find that the best-fit linear regression has a slope (in log-log space) of 0.74 ± 0.12. Including recently published data from Graciá-Carpio et al. tightens the constraints on the best-fit slope to 0.79 ± 0.09. This slope below unity suggests that the HCN(3-2) molecular line luminosity is not linearly tracing the amount of dense gas. Our results are consistent with predictions from recent theoretical models that find slopes below unity when the line luminosity depends on the average gas density with a power-law index greater than a Kennicutt-Schmidt index of 1.5.,https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/338,,,,,,,,,,,

The Merger-Driven Evolution of Warm Infrared Luminous Galaxies,"We present a merger-driven evolutionary model for the production of luminous (LIRGs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with warm infrared (IR) colours. Our results show that simulations of gas-rich major mergers including star formation, black hole growth and feedback can produce warm (U)LIRGs. We also find that while the warm evolutionary phase is associated with increased active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, star formation alone may be sufficient to produce warm IR colours. However, the transition can be suppressed entirely – even when there is a significant AGN contribution – when we assume a single-phase interstellar medium, which maximizes the attenuation. Finally, our evolutionary models are consistent with the 25-to-60 µm flux density ratio versusLHX/LIR relation for local LIRGs and ULIRGs, and predict the observed scatter in IR colour at fixed LHX/LIR. Therefore, our models suggest a cautionary note in the interpretation of warm IR colours: while associated with periods of active black hole growth, they are probably produced by a complex mix of star formation and AGN activity intermediate between the cold star formation dominated phase and the birth of a bright, unobscured quasar.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/353,,,,,,,,,,,

"PSR J1856+0245: Arecibo Discovery of a Young, Energetic Pulsar Coincident with the TeV Gamma-ray Source HESS J1857+026","We present the discovery of the Vela-like radio pulsar J1856+0245 in the Arecibo PALFA survey. PSR J1856+0245 has a spin period of 81 ms, a characteristic age of 21 kyr, and a spin-down luminosity Ė = 4.6 × 1036 ergs s−1. It is positionally coincident with the TeV γ-ray source HESS J1857+026, which has no other known counterparts. Young, energetic pulsars create wind nebulae, and more than a dozen pulsar wind nebulae have been associated with very high energy (100 GeV-100 TeV) γ-ray sources discovered with the HESS telescope. The γ-ray emission seen from HESS J1857+026 is potentially produced by a pulsar wind nebula powered by PSR J1856+0245; faint X-ray emission detected by ASCA at the pulsar's position supports this hypothesis. The inferred γ-ray efficiency is γ = Lγ/Ė =3.1 % (1-10 TeV, for a distance of 9 kpc), comparable to that observed in similar associations.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/383,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell Surface Expression of the Vaccinia Virus Complement Control Protein is Mediated by Interaction with the Viral A56 Protein and Protects Infected Cells from Complement Attack,"The vaccinia virus (VACV) complement control protein (VCP) is the major protein secreted from VACV-infected cells. It has been reported that VCP binds to the surfaces of uninfected cells by interacting with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). In this study, we show that VCP is also expressed on the surfaces of infected cells and demonstrate that surface localization occurs independently of HSPGs. Since VCP does not contain a transmembrane domain, we hypothesized that VCP interacts with a membrane protein that localizes to the infected-cell surface. We show that the VACV A56 membrane protein is necessary for the cell surface expression of VCP and demonstrate that VCP and A56 interact in VACV-infected cells. Since the surface expression of VCP was abrogated by reducing agents, we examined the contribution of an unpaired cysteine residue on VCP to VCP surface expression and VCP's interaction with A56. To do this, we mutated the unpaired cysteine in VCP and generated a recombinant virus expressing the altered form of VCP. Following the infection of cells with the mutant virus, VCP was neither expressed on the cell surface nor able to interact with A56. Importantly, the cell surface expression of VCP was found to protect infected cells from complement-mediated lysis. Our findings suggest a new function for VCP that may be important for poxvirus pathogenesis and impact immune responses to VACV-based vaccines.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/499,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumbal Neurons that are Activated during Cocaine Self-Administration are Spared from Inhibitory Effects of Repeated Cocaine Self-Administration,"Hypoactivity of the accumbens is induced by repeated cocaine exposure and is hypothesized to play a role in cocaine addiction. However, it is difficult to understand how a general hypoactivity of the accumbens, which facilitates multiple types of motivated behaviors, could contribute to the selective increase in drug-directed behavior that defines addiction. Electrophysiological recordings, made during sessions in which rats self-administer cocaine, show that most accumbal neurons that encode events related to drug-directed behavior achieve and maintain higher firing rates during the period of cocaine exposure (Task-Activated neurons) than do other accumbal neurons (Task-Non-Activated neurons).",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/344,,,,,,,,,,,

"Troubling Minds: The Cultural Politics of Genius in the United States, 1840-1890","The nature of genius has long been a subject of fascination and critique. Over the course of the mid- to late-nineteenth century, the representative capacities of the idea of genius in the United States shifted toward an increasingly detailed, psychologized, and sexualized notion of the individual-the genius as pathological subject. In Troubling Minds, Gustavus Stadler takes a broader view, locating in the concept of genius the predecessor to the modern idea of culture. In this book Stadler illuminates genius by examining its changing meanings in American discourses. For example, he unpacks the label of genius by viewing its volatility in relation to the political contingencies of the era, as U.S. society struggled with slavery, civil war, postwar reconciliation, and expansion. Stadler also reveals instances during this period of American history in which writers' uses of the word reflected changes in, as well as resistances to, the dominant understanding of the relationship between culture and politics. Engaging with writers and public figures including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Frederick Douglass, Jenny Lind, William Wells Brown, Louisa May Alcott, and Henry James, Troubling Minds demonstrates how racial, sexual, and class politics of the day influenced the perception of genius. Many critics today treat genius skeptically (if not with outright hostility) because they believe that it operates outside of history. Troubling Minds situates genius into a historical context, placing it firmly in a national intellectual discourse that was grappling not only with grave political crises but also with vast transformations in the ways in which literature was produced, distributed, and consumed. Stadler revitalizes the idea of genius and reintroduces it to our lingua franca. --publisher-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/english_facpubs/89,,,,,,,,,,,

Semi-automated Quantification of Axonal Densities in Labeled CNS Tissue,"Current techniques used to quantify axons often rely upon manual quantification or potentially expensive commercially available programs for automated quantification. We describe a computerized method for the detection and quantification of axons in the rat CNS using readily available free software. Feature J, a java-based plug-in to the imaging software NIH Image J, faithfully detects linear structures such as axons in confocal or bright-field images using a Hessian-based algorithm. We validated the method by comparing values obtained by manual and automated analyses of axons induced to grow in response to neurotrophin over-expression in the rat spinal cord. We also demonstrated that the program can be used to quantify neurotrophin-induced growth of lesioned serotonergic axons in the rat cortex, where manual measurement would be impractical due to dense axonal growth. The use of this software suite provided faster and less biased quantification of labeled axons in comparison to manual measurements at no cost.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/504,,,,,,,,,,,

Using observed values (and ranges of values) for the cluster metallicity, reddening, distance modulus, and age we compare these data to recent alpha-enhanced stellar evolution models for low mass metal-poor stars. We describe several methods of making comparisons between theoretical and observed luminosity functions in order to isolate the evolutionary timescale information the luminosity functions contain. We find no significant evidence of excesses of stars on the red giant branch, although the morphology of the subgiant branch in the observed luminosity function does not match theoretical predictions in a satisfactory way. Current uncertainties in Teff-color transformations (and possibly also in other physics inputs to the models) make more detailed conclusions about the subgiant branch morphology impossible. Given the recent constraints on cluster ages from the WMAP experiment (Spergel et al. 2003), we find that good fitting models that do not include He diffusion (both color-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions) are too old (by approximately 1-2 Gyr) to adequately represent the cluster luminosity function. The inclusion of helium diffusion in the models provides an age reduction (compared to non-diffusive models) that is consistent with the age of the universe being 13.7+/-0.2 Gyr (Bennett et al. 2003).",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/384,,,,,,,,,,,

Simulated Molecular Outflows in Galaxy Mergers with Embedded AGN,"We study the effects of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) on emission from molecular gas in galaxy mergers by combining hydrodynamic simulations that include black holes with a three-dimensional, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer code. We find that molecular clouds entrained in AGN winds produce an extended CO morphology with significant off-nuclear emission, which may be detectable via contour mapping. Furthermore, kinematic signatures of these molecular outflows are visible in emission-line profiles when the outflow has a large line-of-sight velocity. Our results can help interpret current and upcoming observations of luminous infrared galaxies, as well as provide a detailed test of subresolution prescriptions for supermassive black hole growth in galaxy-scale hydrodynamic simulations.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/343,,,,,,,,,,,
Molecular Line Emission from Gravitationally Unstable Protoplanetary Disks,"In the era of high-resolution submillimeter interferometers, it will soon be possible to observe the neutral circumstellar medium directly involved in gas giant planet (GGP) formation at physical scales previously unattainable. In order to explore possible signatures of GGP formation via disk instabilities, we have combined a three-dimensional (3D), nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer code with a 3D, finite differences hydrodynamical code to model molecular emission lines from the vicinity of a 1.4MJ self-gravitating proto-GGP. Here we explore the properties of rotational transitions of the commonly observed dense gas tracer, HCO+. Our main results are as follows: (1) Very high lying HCO+ transitions (e.g., HCO+ J = 7-6) can trace dense clumps around circumstellar disks. Depending on the molecular abundance, the proto-GGP may be directly imageable by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). (2) HCO+ emission lines are heavily self-absorbed through the proto-GGP's dense molecular core. This signature is nearly ubiquitous and only weakly dependent on assumed HCO+ abundances. The self-absorption features are most pronounced at higher angular resolutions. Dense clumps that are not self-gravitating only show minor self-absorption features. (3) Line temperatures are highest through the proto-GGP at all assumed abundances and inclination angles. Conversely, due to self-absorption in the line, the velocity-integrated intensity may not be. High angular resolution interferometers such as the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and ALMA may be able to differentiate between competing theories of GGP formation.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/342,,,,,,,,,,,

Discovery of 14 Radio Pulsars in a Survey of the Magellanic Clouds,"A systematic survey of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds for radio pulsars using the Parkes radio telescope and the 20 cm multibeam receiver has resulted in the discovery of 14 pulsars and the redetection of five of the eight previously known spin-powered pulsars believed to lie in the Magellanic Clouds. Of the 14 new discoveries, 12 are believed to lie within Clouds, three in the Small Cloud and nine in the Large Cloud, bringing the total number of known spin-powered pulsars in the Clouds to 20. Averaged over all positions within the survey area, the survey had a limiting flux density of about 0.12 mJy. Observed dispersion measures suggest that the mean free electron density in the Magellanic Clouds is similar to that in the disk of our Galaxy. The observed radio luminosities have little or no dependence on pulsar period or characteristic age and the differential luminosity function is consistent with a power-law slope of -1, as is observed for Galactic pulsars.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/439,,,,,,,,,,,

A Survey of 56 Midlatitude EGRET Error Boxes for Radio Pulsars,"We have conducted a radio pulsar survey of 56 unidentified γ-ray sources from the third EGRET catalog that are at intermediate Galactic latitudes (5° < |b| < 73°). For each source, four interleaved 35 minute pointings were made with the 13 beam, 1400 MHz multibeam receiver on the Parkes 64 m radio telescope. This covered the 95% error box of each source at a limiting sensitivity of ~0.2 mJy to pulsed radio emission for periods P  10 ms and dispersion measures 50 pc cm-3. Roughly half of the unidentified γ-ray sources at |b| > 5° with no proposed active galactic nucleus counterpart were covered in this survey. We detected nine isolated pulsars and four recycled binary pulsars, with three from each class being new discoveries. Timing observations suggest that only one of the pulsars has a spin-down luminosity that is even marginally consistent with the inferred luminosity of its coincident EGRET source. Our results suggest that population models, which include the Gould Belt as a component, overestimate the number of isolated pulsars among the midlatitude Galactic γ-ray sources, and that it is unlikely that Gould Belt pulsars make up the majority of these sources. However, the possibility of steep pulsar radio spectra and the confusion of terrestrial radio interference with long-period pulsars (P  200 ms) having very low dispersion measures (10 pc cm-3, expected for sources at a distance of less than about 1 kpc) prevent us from strongly ruling out this hypothesis. Our results also do not support the hypothesis that millisecond pulsars make up the majority of these sources. Nonpulsar source classes should therefore be further investigated as possible counterparts to the unidentified EGRET sources at intermediate Galactic latitudes.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/442,,,,,,,,,,,

The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey: VI. Discovery and Timing of 142 Pulsars and a Galactic Population Analysis,"We present the discovery and follow-up observations of 142 pulsars found in the Parkes 20-cm multibeam pulsar survey of the Galactic plane. These new discoveries bring the total number of pulsars found by the survey to 742. In addition to tabulating spin and astrometric parameters, along with pulse width and flux density information, we present orbital characteristics for 13 binary pulsars which form part of the new sample. Combining these results from another recent Parkes multibeam survey at high Galactic latitudes, we have a sample of 1008 normal pulsars which we use to carry out a determination of their Galactic distribution and birth rate. We infer a total Galactic population of 30 000 ± 1100 potentially detectable pulsars (i.e. those beaming towards us) having 1.4-GHz luminosities above 0.1 mJy kpc2. Adopting the Tauris & Manchester beaming model, this translates to a total of 155 000 ± 6000 active radio pulsars in the Galaxy above this luminosity limit. Using a pulsar current analysis, we derive the birth rate of this population to be 1.4 ± 0.2 pulsars per century. An important conclusion from our work is that the inferred radial density function of pulsars depends strongly on the assumed distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy. As a result, any analyses using the most recent electron model of Cordes & Lazio predict a dearth of pulsars in the inner Galaxy. We show that this model can also bias the inferred pulsar scaleheight with respect to the Galactic plane. Combining our results with other Parkes multibeam surveys we find that the population is best described by an exponential distribution with a scaleheight of 330 pc. Surveys underway at Parkes and Arecibo are expected to improve the knowledge of the radial distribution outside the solar circle, and to discover several hundred new pulsars in the inner Galaxy.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/440,,,,,,,,,,,

Elastic instabilities of polymer solutions in cross-channel flow,"This paper, which has two Haverford student co-authors, shows novel instabilities of polymer solutions at low Reynolds number, under conditions where ordinary fluids would not show any instability. At low Reynolds number, viscoelastic fluids can exhibit instabilities in flows that have curved streamlines. We are exploring the behavior of viscoelastic solutions in a microchannel cross flow that contains a stagnation point. We have developed the capability of studying the velocity field as a function of time by tracking fluorescent particles. From the velocity fields, we can determine the position of the stagnation point accurately. We find that when the shear rate is sufficiently high in comparison to the inverse of the polymer relaxation time, the position of the stagnation point begins to fluctuate. The effect does not occur for rigid polymer solutions, or for Newtonian fluids. -- author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/99,,,,,,,,,,,

In Situ Expression of BDNF or NT-3 Promotes Sprouting of Cortical Serotonergic Fibers Following a Neurotoxic Injury,"Neurotrophins promote sprouting and elongation of central nervous system (CNS) axons following injury. Consequently, it has been suggested that neurotrophins could be used to repair the CNS by inducing axonal sprouting from nearby intact axons, thereby compensating for the loss of recently injured axons. We tested whether long-term overexpression of neurotrophins in the rat cortex would induce sprouting of cortical serotonergic axons following a neurotoxic injury. After a single subcutaneous injection of para-chloroamphetamine (PCA; 9 mg/ml) that lesions the majority of serotonergic axons in the rat cortex, we injected adenoviral vectors containing cDNAs for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Adv.BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (Adv.NT-3), or nerve growth factor (Adv.NGF) into the rat frontal cortex. Nine days later, we measured significant increases in the concentration of the respective neurotrophins surrounding the vector injection sites, as measured by ELISA. Immunohistochemical localization of serotonin revealed a fourfold increase in the density of serotonergic fibers surrounding the injection sites of Adv.BDNF and Adv.NT-3, corresponding to a 50% increase in cortical serotonin concentration, compared with a control vector containing the cDNA for enhanced green fluorescent protein (Adv.EGFP). In contrast, there was no difference in serotonergic fiber density or cortical serotonin concentration surrounding the injection of Adv.NGF compared with Adv.EGFP. These data demonstrate that localized overexpression of BDNF or NT-3, but not NGF, is sufficient to promote sprouting of serotonergic axons in the cortex following an experimental neurotoxic injury.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/505,,,,,,,,,,,

The Correspondence Between Augmentations and Rulings for Legendrian Knots,"""This paper investigates connections between two different invariants for Legendrian knots.  Though the geometry behind the two invariants, called rulings and ""augmentations,"" differs greatly, they are tantalizingly similar to compute in practice.  In fact, as this paper shows, there is a connection between the two: namely that one can find the augmentation invariant (an integer) of a Legendrian knot using its ruling invariant (a polynomial).  This result provides a starting point for further investigations into connections between the two larger geometric ideas behind the invariants."" --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/mathematics_facpubs/87,,,,,,,,,,,

Variability Tests for Intrinsic Absorption Lines in Quasar Spectra,"Quasar spectra have a variety of absorption lines whose origins range from energetic winds expelled from the central engines to unrelated, intergalactic clouds. We present multiepoch, medium-resolution spectra of eight quasars at z ~ 2 that have narrow ""associated"" absorption lines (AALs, within ±5000 km s-1 of the emission redshift). Two of these quasars were also known previously to have high-velocity mini-broad absorption lines (mini-BALs). We use these data, spanning ~17 yr in the observed frame with 2-4 observations per object, to search for line-strength variations as an identifier of absorption that occurs physically near (""intrinsic"" to) the central active galactic nucleus. Our main results are the following: Two out of the eight quasars with narrow AALs exhibit variable AAL strengths. Two out of two quasars with high-velocity mini-BALs exhibit variable mini-BAL strengths. We also marginally detect variability in a high-velocity narrow absorption line system, blueshifted ~32,900 km s-1 with respect to the emission lines. No other absorption lines in these quasars appeared to vary. The outflow velocities of the variable AALs are 3140 and 1490 km s-1. The two mini-BALs identify much higher velocity outflows of ~28,400 and ~52,000 km s-1. Our temporal sampling yields upper limits on the variation timescales from 0.28 to 6.1 yr in the quasar rest frames. The corresponding minimum electron densities in the variable absorbers, based on the recombination timescale, are ~40,000 to ~1900 cm-3. The maximum distances of the absorbers from the continuum source, assuming photoionization with no spectral shielding, range from ~1.8 to ~7 kpc.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/346,,,,,,,,,,,

A Search for Radio Emission from the Young 16-ms Pulsar PSR J0537-6910,"PSR J0537−6910 is a young, energetic, rotation-powered X-ray pulsar with a spin period of 16 ms located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We have searched for previously undetected radio pulsations (both giant and standard) from this pulsar in a 12-h observation taken at 1400 MHz with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. The very large value of the magnetic field at the light cylinder radius suggests that this pulsar might be emitting giant radio pulses like those seen in other pulsars with similar field strengths. No radio emission of either kind was detected from the pulsar, and we have established an upper limit of ∼25 mJy kpc2 for the average 1400-MHz radio luminosity of PSR J0537−6910. The 5σ single-pulse detection threshold was ∼750 mJy for a single 80-μs sample. These limits are likely to be the best obtainable until searches with greatly improved sensitivity can be made with next-generation radio instruments.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/437,,,,,,,,,,,

[CI] 809 GHz Imaging of the NGC 6334 Complex,"We present Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory (AST/RO) observations of submillimeter emissions from the NGC 6334 complex for both the 12[CI]3P2→3P1 fine-structure line of atomic carbon and the 12COJ=4→3 rotational transition of CO. We detected strong 12[CI]3P2→3P1 emission from the entire star-forming NGC 6334 complex, and present maps of 12[CI]3P2→3P1 emission and 12COJ=4→3 emission. Comparing these maps with archival ASCA data, we show that, to the south of NGC 6334, the [C I] emissions are likely to be associated with strong X-ray emissions from the FIR sources. However, the calculation using the X-ray dissociation region model shows that the majority of the [C I] emission can not arise from X-ray dissociation of the cloud. Alternatively, far-ultraviolet radiation produced in the photodissociation regions is expected to contribute to dissociate the carbon monoxide in the NGC 6334 complex.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/344,,,,,,,,,,,

The Unusual Luminosity Function of the Globular Cluster M10,"We present the I-band luminosity function of the differentially reddened globular cluster M10. We combine photometric analysis derived from wide-field (23'×23') images that include the outer regions of the cluster and high-resolution images of the cluster core. After making corrections for incompleteness and field star contamination, we find that the relative numbers of stars on the lower giant branch and near the main-sequence turnoff are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. However, we detect significant (>6 σ) excesses of red giant branch stars above and below the red giant branch bump using a new statistic (a population ratio) for testing relative evolutionary timescales of main-sequence and red giant stars. The statistic is insensitive to assumed cluster chemical composition, age, and main-sequence mass function. The excess number of red giants cannot be explained by reasonable systematic errors in our assumed cluster chemical composition, age, or main-sequence mass function. Moreover, M10 shows excesses when compared to the cluster M12, which has nearly identical metallicity, age, and color-magnitude diagram morphology. We discuss possible reasons for this anomaly, finding that the most likely cause is a mass function slope that shows significant variations as a function of mass.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/382,,,,,,,,,,,

"Warm-Dense Molecular Gas in the ISM of Starbursts, LIRGs and ULIRGs","The role of star formation in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs, LIR ≥ 1011 L☉; ULIRGs, LIR ≥ 1012 L☉) is a hotly debated issue: while it is clear that starbursts play a large role in powering the IR luminosity in these galaxies, the relative importance of possible enshrouded AGNs is unknown. It is therefore important to better understand the role of star-forming gas in contributing to the infrared luminosity in IR-bright galaxies. The J = 3 level of 12CO lies 33 K above ground and has a critical density of ~1.5 × 104 cm-3. The 12CO J = 3-2 line serves as an effective tracer for warm, dense molecular gas heated by active star formation. Here we report on 12CO J = 3-2 observations of 17 starburst spiral galaxies, LIRGs, and ULIRGs, which we obtained with the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope on Mount Graham, Arizona. Our main results are as follows. (1) We find a nearly linear relation between the infrared luminosity and warm, dense molecular gas such that the infrared luminosity increases as the warm, dense molecular gas to the power 0.92; we interpret this to be roughly consistent with the recent results of Gao & Solomon. (2) We find LIR/M ratios ranging from ~38 to ~482 L☉/M☉ using a modified CO-H2conversion factor of 8.3 × 1019 cm-2 (K km s-1)-1 derived in this paper.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/345,,,,,,,,,,,

Two Checkpoint Complexes Are Independently Recruited to Sites of DNA Damage in vivo,"The Ddc1/Rad17/Mec3 complex and Rad24 are DNA damage checkpoint components with limited homology to replication factors PCNA and RF-C, respectively, suggesting that these factors promote checkpoint activation by ""sensing"" DNA damage directly. Mec1 kinase, however, phosphorylates the checkpoint protein Ddc2 in response to damage in the absence of all other known checkpoint proteins, suggesting instead that Mec1 and/or Ddc2 may act as the initial sensors of DNA damage. In this paper, we show that Ddc1 or Ddc2 fused to GFP localizes to a single subnuclear focus following an endonucleolytic break. Other forms of damage result in a greater number of Ddc1-GFP or Ddc2-GFP foci, in correlation with the number of damage sites generated, indicating that Ddc1 and Ddc2 are both recruited to sites of DNA damage. Interestingly, Ddc2 localization is severely abrogated in mec1 cells but requires no other known checkpoint genes, whereas Ddc1 localization requires Rad17, Mec3, and Rad24, but not Mec1. Therefore, Ddc1 and Ddc2 recognize DNA damage by independent mechanisms. These data support a model in which assembly of multiple checkpoint complexes at DNA damage sites stimulates checkpoint activation. Further, we show that although Ddc1 remains strongly localized following checkpoint adaptation, many nuclei contain only dim foci of Ddc2-GFP, suggesting that Ddc2 localization may be down-regulated during resumption of cell division. Lastly, visualization of checkpoint proteins localized to damage sites serves as a useful tool for analysis of DNA damage in living cells.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/biology_facpubs/511,,,,,,,,,,,

Effect of Disorder on Synchronization in Prototype 2-D Josephson Arrays,"We study the effects of quenched disorder on the dynamics of two-dimensional arrays of overdamped Josephson junctions. Disorder in both the junction critical currents and resistances is considered. Analytical results for small arrays are used to identify a physical mechanism which promotes frequency locking across each row of the array, and to show that no such locking mechanism exists between rows. The intrarow locking mechanism is surprisingly strong, so that a row can tolerate large amounts of disorder before frequency locking is destroyed.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/557,,,,,,,,,,,

We identify the transition boundary between synchronized and desynchronized behavior, along with the mechanism responsible for the loss of frequency locking.

Discovery of a Young Radio Pulsar in a Relativistic Binary Orbit,"We report on the discovery of PSR J1141-6545, a radio pulsar in an eccentric, relativistic 5 hr binary orbit. The pulsar shows no evidence of being recycled, having a pulse period P = 394 ms, a characteristic age τc = 1.4 × 106 yr, and an inferred surface magnetic dipole field strength B = 1.3 × 1012 G. From the mass function and measured rate of periastron advance, we determine the total mass in the system to be 2.300 ± 0.012 M☉, assuming that the periastron advance is purely relativistic. Under the same assumption we constrain the pulsar's mass to be Mp ≤ 1.348 M☉, and the companion's mass to be Mc > 0.968M☉ (both with 99% confidence). Given the total system mass and the distribution of measured neutron star masses, the companion is probably a massive white dwarf that formed prior to the birth of the pulsar. Optical observations can test this hypothesis.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/459,,,,,,,,,,,

A Search for Submillisecond Pulsations from Unidentified FIRST and NVSS Radio Sources,"We have searched 92 unidentified sources from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) 1400 MHz radio survey catalogs for radio pulsations at 610 MHz. The selected radio sources are bright, have no identification with extragalactic objects, are pointlike, and are more than 5% linearly polarized. Our search was sensitive to submillisecond pulsations from pulsars with dispersion measures less than ~500 pc cm-3 in the absence of scattering. We have detected no pulsations from these sources and consider possible effects that might prevent detection. We conclude that, as a population, these sources are unlikely to be pulsars.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/466,,,,,,,,,,,

Discovery of Two High Magnetic Field Radio Pulsars,"We report the discovery of two young isolated radio pulsars with very high inferred magnetic fields. PSR J1119-6127 has period P = 0.407 s, and the largest period derivative known among radio pulsars, = 4.0 × 10-12. Under standard assumptions these parameters imply a characteristic spin-down age of only τc = 1.6 kyr and a surface dipole magnetic field strength of B = 4.1 × 1013 G. We have measured a stationary period second derivative for this pulsar, resulting in a braking index of n = 2.91 ± 0.05. We have also observed a glitch in the rotation of the pulsar, with fractional period change ΔP/P = -4.4 ×10-9. Archival radio imaging data suggest the presence of a previously uncataloged supernova remnant centered on the pulsar. The second pulsar, PSR J1814-1744, has P = 3.975 s and = 7.4 × 10-13. These parameters imply τc = 85 kyr, and B = 5.5 ×1013 G, the largest of any known radio pulsar.
Both PSR J1119-6127 and PSR J1814-1744 show apparently normal radio emission in a regime of magnetic field strength where some models predict that no emission should occur. Also, PSR J1814-1744 has spin parameters similar to the anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP) 1E 2259+586, but shows no discernible X-ray emission. If AXPs are isolated, high magnetic field neutron stars (""magnetars""), these results suggest that their unusual attributes are unlikely to be merely a consequence of their very high inferred magnetic fields.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/467,,,,,,,,,,,

X-ray Observations of the New Pulsar-Supernova Remnant System PSR J1119-6127 and Supernova Remnant G292.2-0.5,"PSR J1119-6127 is a recently discovered 1600-yr-old radio pulsar that has a very high inferred surface dipolar magnetic field. We present a detailed analysis of a pointed ASCA observation and archival ROSAT data of PSR J1119-6127 and its surroundings. Both data sets reveal extended emission coincident with the newly discovered radio supernova remnant G292.2-0.5, which is reported in a companion paper by Crawford et al. A hard point source, offset ~15 from the position of the radio pulsar, is seen with the ASCA Gas Imaging Spectrometer (GIS). No pulsations are detected at the radio period with a pulsed fraction upper limit of 61% (95% confidence). The limited statistics prevent a detailed spectral analysis, although a power-law model with photon index Γ ≈ 1-2 describes the data well. Both the spectral model and derived X-ray luminosity are consistent with those measured for other young radio pulsars, although the spatial offset renders an identification of the source as the X-ray counterpart of the pulsar uncertain.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/455,,,,,,,,,,,
PSR J1740-3052: a Pulsar with a Massive Companion,"We report on the discovery of a binary pulsar, PSR J1740−3052, during the Parkes multibeam survey. Timing observations of the 570-ms pulsar at Jodrell Bank and Parkes show that it is young, with a characteristic age of 350 kyr, and is in a 231-d, highly eccentric orbit with a companion whose mass exceeds 11 M⊙. An accurate position for the pulsar was obtained using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Near-infrared 2.2-μm observations made with the telescopes at the Siding Spring observatory reveal a late-type star coincident with the pulsar position. However, we do not believe that this star is the companion of the pulsar, because a typical star of this spectral type and required mass would extend beyond the orbit of the pulsar. Furthermore, the measured advance of periastron of the pulsar suggests a more compact companion, for example, a main-sequence star with radius only a few times that of the Sun. Such a companion is also more consistent with the small dispersion measure variations seen near periastron. Although we cannot conclusively rule out a black hole companion, we believe that the companion is probably an early B star, making the system similar to the binary PSR J0045−7319.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/456,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-Uniform Free-Free Absorption in the GPS Radio Galaxy 0108+388,"We have observed the canonical gigahertz-peaked spectrum source 0108+388 with the Very Long Baseline Array at a range of frequencies above and below the spectral peak. The activity that dominates the radio emission from 0108+388, which is also classified as a compact symmetric object, is thought to be less than 1000 years old. We present strong evidence that the spectral turnover in 0108+388 results from free-free absorption by nonuniform gas, possibly in the form of a disk in the central tens of parsecs.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/461,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Parkes Multi-Beam Pulsar Survey - I. Observing and Data Analysis Systems, Discovery and Timing of 100 Pulsars","The Parkes multi-beam pulsar survey is a sensitive survey of a strip along the Galactic plane with and to . It uses a 13-beam receiver on the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, receiving two polarizations per beam over a 288-MHz bandwidth centred on 1374 MHz. The receiver and data acquisition systems are described in some detail. For pulsar periods in the range and dispersion measures of less than 300 cm−3 pc, the nominal limiting flux density of the survey is about 0.2 mJy. At shorter or longer periods or higher dispersions, the sensitivity is reduced. Timing observations are carried out for pulsars discovered in the survey for months after confirmation to obtain accurate positions, spin parameters, dispersion measures, pulse shapes and mean flux densities. The survey is proving to be extremely successful, with more than 600 pulsars discovered so far. We expect that, when complete, this one survey will come close to finding as many pulsars as all previous pulsar surveys put together. The newly discovered pulsars tend to be young, distant and of high radio luminosity. They will form a valuable sample for studies of pulsar emission properties, the Galactic distribution and evolution of pulsars, and as probes of interstellar medium properties. This paper reports the timing and pulse shape parameters for the first 100 pulsars timed at Parkes, including three pulsars with periods of less than 100 ms which are members of binary systems. These results are briefly compared with the parameters of the previously known population.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/458,,,,,,,,,,,

The New York City Space Science Research Alliance Enhancing Undergraduate Education and Research: An Educational Initiative Targetting Increased Diversity in Space Science,"The New York City Space Science Research Alliance Program is initiating and enhancing multiple collaborations in Space Science research and developing a Space Science major in the City University of New York Baccalaureate Degree (BS) program. The Alliance is a coalition of CUNY Colleges in collaboration with the Astrophysics Department of the Hayden Planetarium, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The purpose of this initiative is to increase the pool of minority or underrepresented astrophysicists, astronomers and physicists; given the CUNY system with over 200,000 mostly minority students, this represents a unique opportunity to increase the production of minority scientists. The CUNY Baccalaureate Program offers students the chance to earn a BS by completing an individualized program of study and taking courses at any combination of the University's seventeen colleges and at the Graduate School and University Center. o Hayden, GSFC and GISS scientists are assisting in the development of the proposed CUNY BS Degree program in Space Science; o Hayden and GISS scientists will be among the faculty teaching courses in this program and classes will be held at Hayden and GISS; o Concentrations for students will include Planetary Science, Earth-Sun Connection, and Astrophysics; and o Undergraduate research and research related activities will play a significant role in the Space Science program; Research projects include: ""Astrometry and Photometry of Asteroids, Comets with Emphasis on Near Earth Objects (NEO's)"", ""Photometry of Binary and Variable Stars"", ""Radial Distribution of Supernovae in Spiral and Elliptical Galaxies"", ""The Evolution of Galaxies in Groups"", ""Radio Luminosity Extinction in Jets of Extragalactic Radio Sources"", ""The Distribution and Dynamics of Atmospheric Aerosols on Jupiter"" and ""Probing Planetary Surfaces for Micro-Organisms"".",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/434,,,,,,,,,,,

Oscillatory Bifurcation with Broken Translation Symmetry,"The effect of distant endwalls on the bifurcation to traveling waves is considered. Previous approaches have treated the problem by assuming that it is a weak perturbation of the translation invariant problem. When the problem is formulated instead in a finite box of length L and the limit L→∞ is taken, one obtains amplitude equations that differ from the usual Ginzburg-Landau description by the presence of an additional nonlinear term. This formulation leads to a description in terms of the amplitudes of the primary box modes, which are odd and even parity standing waves. For large L, the equations that result take the form of a Hopf bifurcation with approximate D4 symmetry. These equations are able to describe, qualitatively, not only traveling and ""blinking"" states, but also asymmetrical blinking states and ""repeated transients,"" all of which have been observed in binary fluid convection experiments.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/552,,,,,,,,,,,

Two Young Radio Pulsars Coincident with EGRET Sources,"We report the discovery and follow-up timing observations of two young energetic radio pulsars. PSR J1420-6048 has a periodP = 68 ms and period derivative  = 83 × 10-15, implying a characteristic age τc = 13 kyr and a surface dipole magnetic field strength B = 2.4 × 1012 G. PSR J1837-0604 has P = 96 ms and  = 45 × 10-15, implying τc = 34 kyr and B = 2.1 × 1012 G. The two objects have large spin-down luminosities, and, on the basis of an empirical comparison of their properties with those of other young radio pulsars, they are expected to be observable as pulsed γ-ray sources. In fact, they lie within the error circles of γ-ray sources detected by the EGRET instrument on the Gamma Ray Observatory. We show that the pulsars are plausibly associated with the EGRET sources.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/462,,,,,,,,,,,
Spectral Equivalence of Bosons and Fermions in One-Dimensional Harmonic Potentials,"Recently, Schmidt and Schnack [Physica A 260, 479 (1998)], following earlier references, reiterate that the specific heat of N noninteracting bosons in a one-dimensional harmonic well equals that of N noninteracting fermions in the same potential. We show that this peculiar relationship between heat capacities results from a more dramatic equivalence between Bose and Fermi systems. Namely, we prove that the excitations of such Bose and Fermi systems are spectrally equivalent. Two complementary proofs of this equivalence are provided; one based on a combinatoric argument, the other from analysis of the underlying dynamical symmetry group.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/548,,,,,,,,,,,

Polarization Properties of Nine Southern Radio Pulsars,"We report on radio polarimetry observations for nine southern pulsars. Six of the nine in the sample are young, with characteristic ages under 100 kyr and high spin-down luminosities. All six show a significant degree of linear polarization. We also confirm a previously noticed trend in which the degree of linear polarization increases with spin-down luminosity. Where possible, we have used the rotating-vector model of the pulsar emission geometry to fit the observed position angle data. Our fit for PSR J1513-5908 (B1509-58) in particular is useful for directly testing the magnetospheric model of Melatos in combination with further timing observations. For this pulsar we find that a magnetic inclination angle greater than or equal to 60° is excluded at the 3 σ level and that the geometry suggested by the morphology of an apparent bipolar X-ray outflow is marginally inconsistent with the Melatos model. We also report on the polarimetry of three older pulsars: PSR J0045-7319, PSR J1627-4850, and PSR J1316-6232 (whose discovery we also report). Of these, only PSR J0045-7319 shows significant polarization.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/457,,,,,,,,,,,
A Radio Supernova Remnant Associated with the Young Pulsar J1119-6127,"We report on Australia Telescope Compact Array observations in the direction of the young high magnetic-field pulsar J1119-6127. In the resulting images we identify a nonthermal radio shell of diameter 15', which we classify as a previously uncataloged young supernova remnant, G292.2-0.5. This supernova remnant is positionally coincident with PSR J1119-6127, and we conclude that the two objects are physically associated. No radio emission is detected from any pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with the pulsar; our observed upper limits are consistent with the expectation that high magnetic-field pulsars produce radio nebulae that fade rapidly. This system suggests a possible explanation for the lack of an associated radio pulsar and/or PWN in many supernova remnants.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/454,,,,,,,,,,,

Discovery of Five Binary Radio Pulsars,"We report on five binary pulsars discovered in the Parkes multibeam Galactic plane survey. All of the pulsars are old, with characteristic ages (1-11) × 109 yr, and have relatively small inferred magnetic fields, (5-90) × 108 G. The orbital periods range from 1.3 to 15 days. As a group these objects differ from the usual low-mass binary pulsars (LMBPs): their spin periods of 9-88 ms are relatively long; their companion masses, 0.2-1.1 M☉, are, in at least some cases, suggestive of CO or more massive white dwarfs; and some of the orbital eccentricities, 10-5 e 0.002, are unexpectedly large. We argue that these observed characteristics reflect binary evolution that is significantly different from that of LMBPs. We also note that intermediate-mass binary pulsars apparently have a smaller scale height than LMBPs.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/460,,,,,,,,,,,

Radio Pulsars in the Magellanic Clouds,"We report the results of a survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) for radio pulsars conducted with the 20 cm multibeam receiver of the Parkes 64 m telescope. This survey targeted a more complete region of the SMC than a previous pulsar search and had an improvement in sensitivity by a factor of about 2 for most pulsar periods. This survey is much more sensitive to fast young pulsars (with P  100 ms) and is the first survey of the SMC with any sensitivity to millisecond pulsars. Two new pulsars were discovered in the survey, one of which is located within the SMC. The number of pulsars found in the survey is consistent with the expected number derived using several methods. We also report the serendipitous discovery of a new pulsar in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These discoveries bring the total number of rotation-powered pulsars currently known in the Magellanic Clouds to eight. We have also made refined timing measurements for the new discoveries as well as for three previously known LMC pulsars. The age distribution of luminous Magellanic Cloud pulsars supports the conjecture that pulsars younger than about 5 Myr are more luminous on average than older pulsars.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/453,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental Measurements of Stretching Fields in Fluid Mixing,"The mixing of an impurity into a flowing fluid is an important process in many areas of science, including geophysical processes, chemical reactors, and microfluidic devices. In some cases, for example periodic flows, the concepts of nonlinear dynamics provide a deep theoretical basis for understanding mixing. Unfortunately, the building blocks of this theory, i.e. the fixed points and invariant manifolds of the associated Poincaré map, have remained inaccessible to direct experimental study, thus limiting the insight that could be obtained. Using precision measurements of tracer particle trajectories in a two-dimensional fluid flow producing chaotic mixing, we directly measure the time-dependent stretching fields. These quantities, previously available only numerically, attain local maxima along lines coinciding with the stable and unstable manifolds, thus revealing the dynamical structures that control mixing. Contours or level sets of a passive impurity field are found to be aligned parallel to the lines of large stretching at each instant, thus explaining what happens as one stirs milk into coffee. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/85,,,,,,,,,,,

PSR J2021+3651: A Young Radio Pulsar Coincident with an Unidentified EGRET Gamma-ray Source,"We report on a deep search for radio pulsations toward five unidentified ASCA X-ray sources coincident with EGRET γ-ray sources. This search has led to the discovery of a young and energetic pulsar using data obtained with the new Wideband Arecibo Pulsar Processor. PSR J2021+3651 is likely associated with the X-ray source AX J2021.1+3651, which in turn is likely associated with the COS B high-energy γ-ray source 2CG 075+00, also known as GeV J2020+3658 or 3EG J2021+3716. PSR J2021+3651 has a rotation period of P ~ 104 ms and  ~ 9.6 × 10-14, implying a characteristic age of τc ~ 17 kyr and a spin-down luminosity of  ~ 3.4 ×1036 ergs s-1. The dispersion measure DM ~ 371 pc cm-3 is by far the highest of any observed pulsar in the Galactic longitude range 55° < l < 80°. This DM suggests a distance d  10 kpc and a high γ-ray efficiency of ~15%, but the true distance may be closer if there is a significant contribution to the DM from excess gas in the Cygnus region. The implied luminosity of the associated X-ray source suggests the X-ray emission is dominated by a pulsar wind nebula unresolved by ASCA.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/449,,,,,,,,,,,

The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey - II. Discovery and Timing of 120 Pulsars,"The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey is a sensitive survey of a strip of the Galactic plane with |b| < 5° and 260° < l < 50° at 1374 MHz. Here we report the discovery of 120 new pulsars and subsequent timing observations, primarily using the 76-m Lovell radio telescope at Jodrell Bank. The main features of the sample of 370 published pulsars discovered during the multibeam survey are described. Furthermore, we highlight two pulsars: PSR J1734−3333, a young pulsar with the second highest surface magnetic field strength among the known radio pulsars, Bs= 5.4 × 1013 G, and PSR J1830−1135, the second slowest radio pulsar known, with a 6-s period.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/448,,,,,,,,,,,

X-ray Observations of the Compact Central Object in Supernova Remnant G347.3-0.5,"We present Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer observations of 1WGA J1713.4-3949, a compact source at the center of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G347.3-0.5. The X-ray spectrum of the source is well fitted by the sum of a blackbody component with a temperature of ~0.4 keV plus a power-law component with a photon index of ~4. We found no pulsations down to 4% in the 0.01-0.16 Hz range nor down to 25% in the 0.01-128 Hz range. This source resembles other compact central objects in SNRs, and we suggest that 1WGA J1713.4-3949 is the associated neutron star for G347.3-0.5. We also measured the properties of the adjacent radio pulsar PSR J1713-3945 with a 392 ms period, and we show that it is not associated with 1WGA J1713.4-3949 nor, most probably, is it associated with SNR G347.3-0.5.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/443,,,,,,,,,,,

The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey - III. Young Pulsars and the Discovery and Timing of 200 Pulsars,"The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey has unlocked vast areas of the Galactic plane, which were previously invisible to earlier low-frequency and less-sensitive surveys. The survey has discovered more than 600 new pulsars so far, including many that are young and exotic. In this paper we report the discovery of 200 pulsars for which we present positional and spin-down parameters, dispersion measures, flux densities and pulse profiles. A large number of these new pulsars are young and energetic, and we review possible associations of γ-ray sources with the sample of about 1300 pulsars for which timing solutions are known. Based on a statistical analysis, we estimate that about 19 ± 6 associations are genuine. The survey has also discovered 12 pulsars with spin properties similar to those of the Vela pulsar, nearly doubling the known population of such neutron stars. Studying the properties of all known ‘Vela-like’ pulsars, we find their radio luminosities to be similar to normal pulsars, implying that they are very inefficient radio sources. Finally, we review the use of the newly discovered pulsars as Galactic probes and discuss the implications of the new NE2001 Galactic electron density model for the determination of pulsar distances and luminosities.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/452,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of Intergalactic Gas in Distant Rich Clusters,"Radio observations of three Abell clusters of galaxies of richness class 4 and distance class 6 at a wavelength of 9 mm are reported which reveal a reduction in intensity or a 'cooling' of the cosmic microwave background as this radiation passes through the clusters. The 'cooling' effect is attributed to inverse Compton scattering of the microwave photons by hot intergalactic gas in the clusters. The measured changes in the temperature of the microwave background are given along with their associated standard deviations of the mean, and approximate values of the proton density in the clusters are derived under the assumptions of a specific adiabatic model. An apparent strong correlation is noted between richness class and the detectability of the inverse Compton 'cooling'. It is suggested that the three rich clusters observed should be luminous X-ray sources.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/311,,,,,,,,,,,

A Search for the Radio Counterpart of the Unidentified Gamma-ray Source 3EG J1410-6147,"We have made radio continuum, H i and X-ray observations in the direction of the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1410–6147, using the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The observations encompass the supernova remnant (SNR) G312.4–0.4 and the two young pulsars PSRs J1412–6145 and J1413–6141.
We derive a lower distance limit of 6 kpc to the SNR, although interpretation of positive velocity features in the H i spectrum may imply that the SNR is more distant than 14 kpc. PSR J1412–6145, with an age of 50 kyr, is the pulsar most probably associated with SNR G312.4–0.4. X-rays are not detected from either pulsar and diffuse X-ray emission near the bright western edge of the SNR is weak. Although there is circumstantial evidence that this western region is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), the embedded pulsar PSR J1412–6145 is apparently not sufficiently powerful to explain the radio enhancement. The origin of the electron acceleration in this region and of the γ-rays remains unidentified, unless the distance to PSR J1413–6141 is at least a factor of 3 lower than its dispersion measure distance.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/450,,,,,,,,,,,

The Emergence of Temporal Correlations in a Study of Global Economic Interdependence,We develop a simple firm-based automaton model for global economic interdependence of countries using modern notions of self-organized criticality and recently developed dynamical renormalization-group methods.

Potential policy implications of this result are also discussed.,https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/549,,,,,,,,,,,

Radio Polarization of the Young High-Magnetic-Field Pulsar PSR J1119-6127,"We have investigated the radio polarization properties of PSR J1119-6127, a recently discovered young radio pulsar with a large magnetic field. Using pulsar-gated radio imaging data taken at a center frequency of 2496 MHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we have determined a rotation measure for the pulsar of +842 ± 23 rad m-2. These data, combined with archival polarimetry data taken at a center frequency of 1366 MHz with the Parkes telescope, were used to determine the polarization characteristics of PSR J1119-6127 at both frequencies. The pulsar has a fractional linear polarization of ~75% and ~55% at 1366 and 2496 MHz, respectively, and the profile consists of a single, wide component. This pulse morphology and high degree of linear polarization are in agreement with previously noticed trends for young pulsars (e.g., PSR J1513-5908). A rotating vector (RV) model fit of the position angle of linear polarization over pulse phase using the Parkes data suggests that the radio emission comes from the leading edge of a conal beam. We discuss PSR J1119-6127 in the context of a recent theoretical model of pulsar spin-down, which can in principle be tested with polarization and timing data from this pulsar. Geometric constraints from the RV fit are currently insufficient to test this model with statistical significance, but additional data may allow such a test in the future.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/451,,,,,,,,,,,
A Comparison of Measured Crab and Vela Glitch Healing Parameters with Predictions of Neutron Star Models,"There are currently two well-accepted models that explain how pulsars exhibit glitches, sudden changes in their regular rotational spin-down. According to the starquake model, the glitch healing parameter Q, which is measurable in some cases from pulsar timing, should be equal to the ratio of the moment of inertia of the superfluid core of a neutron star (NS) to its total moment of inertia. Measured values of the healing parameter from pulsar glitches can therefore be used in combination with realistic NS structure models as one test of the feasibility of the starquake model as a glitch mechanism. We have constructed NS models using seven representative equations of state of superdense matter to test whether starquakes can account for glitches observed in the Crab and Vela pulsars, for which the most extensive and accurate glitch data are available. We also present a compilation of all measured values of Q for Crab and Vela glitches to date that have been separately published in the literature. We have computed the fractional core moment of inertia for stellar models covering a range of NS masses and find that for stable NSs in the realistic mass range 1.4 ± 0.2 M☉, the fraction is greater than 0.55 in all cases. This range is not consistent with the observational restriction Q  0.2 for Vela if starquakes are the cause of its glitches. This confirms results of previous studies of the Vela pulsar that have suggested that starquakes are not a feasible mechanism for Vela glitches. The much larger values of Q observed for Crab glitches (Q  0.7) are consistent with starquake model predictions and support previous conclusions that starquakes can be the cause of Crab glitches.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/444,,,,,,,,,,,

Pulsar Birthrates from the Parkes Multibeam Survey,"We investigate the pulsar birthrate from a sample of 815 nonrecycled pulsars detected by the Parkes multibeam survey, accounting as accurately as possible for all known selection effects. We find that pulsars with magnetic fields greater than 2.5 ×1012 G account for more than half of the total birthrate in spite of comprising only about 5%-10% of the total Galactic population. While we do not find evidence for a significant population of pulsars ""injected"" into the population with spin periods of ~0.5 s, we do find that many, perhaps 40%, are born with periods in the range 0.1-0.5 s. The absolute number and birthrate of Galactic pulsars is strongly dependent on the assumed models for pulsar beaming and Galactic electron distribution. Adopting the most recent models, we find the total pulsar birthrate to be between 0.9 and 1.9 pulsars per century for 1400 MHz luminosities greater than 1 mJy kpc2, and the total Galactic population of active radio pulsars above this luminosity limit to be between 70,000 and 120,000.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/447,,,,,,,,,,,

PSR J2021+3651: A New Gamma-Ray Pulsar Candidate,"The COS B high energy γ-ray source 2CG 075+00, also known as GeV J2020+3658 or 3EG J2021+3716, has avoided identification with a low energy counterpart for over 20 years. We present a likely identification with the discovery and subsequent timing of a young and energetic pulsar, PSR J2021+3651, with the Wideband Arecibo Pulsar Processor at the Arecibo Observatory. PSR J2021+3651 has a rotation periodP∼104 ms and , implying a characteristic age τc∼17 kyr and a spin-down luminosity erg s−1. The pulsar is also coincident with the ASCA source AX J2021.1+3651. The implied luminosity of the associated X-ray source suggests the X-ray emission is dominated by a pulsar wind nebula unresolved by ASCA. The pulsar’s unexpectedly high dispersion measure (DM ∼ 371 pc cm−3) and the d⩾10 kpc DM distance pose a new question: is PSR J2021+3651 an extremely efficient γ-ray pulsar at the edge of the Galaxy? This is a question for AGILE and GLAST to answer.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/445,,,,,,,,,,,

The 69 Millisecond Radio Pulsar Near the Supernova Remnant RCW 103,"We report the detection of the radio pulsar counterpart to the 69 ms X-ray pulsar discovered near the supernova remnant RCW 103 (G332.4-0.4). Our detection confirms that the pulsations arise from a rotation-powered neutron star, which we name PSR J1617-5055. The observed barycentric period derivative confirms that the pulsar has a characteristic age of only 8 kyr, the sixth youngest of all known pulsars. The unusual apparent youth of the pulsar and its proximity to a young remnant require that an association be considered. Although the respective ages and distances are consistent within substantial uncertainties, the large inferred pulsar transverse velocity is difficult to explain given the observed pulsar velocity distribution, the absence of evidence for a pulsar wind nebula, and the symmetry of the remnant. Rather, we argue that the objects are likely superposed on the sky; this is reasonable given the complex area. Without an association, the question of where is the supernova remnant left behind following the birth of PSR J1617-5055 remains open. We also discuss a possible association between PSR J1617-5055 and the γ-ray source 2CG 333+01. Although an association is energetically plausible, it is unlikely given that EGRET did not detect 2CG 333+01.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/464,,,,,,,,,,,

The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey - IV. Discovery of 180 Pulsars and Parameters for 281 Previously Known Pulsars,"The Parkes multibeam pulsar survey has led to the discovery of more than 700 pulsars. In this paper, we provide timing solutions, flux densities and pulse profiles for 180 of these new discoveries. Two pulsars, PSRs J1736−2843 and J1847−0130, have rotational periods P> 6 s and are therefore among the slowest rotating radio pulsars known. Conversely, with P= 1.8 ms, PSR J1843−1113 has the third-shortest period of pulsars currently known. This pulsar and PSR J1905+0400 (P= 3.8 ms) are both solitary. We also provide orbital parameters for a new binary system, PSR J1420−5625, which has P= 34 ms, an orbital period of 40 d and a minimum companion mass of 0.4 solar masses. The 10°-wide strip along the Galactic plane that was surveyed is known to contain 264 radio pulsars that were discovered prior to the multibeam pulsar survey. We have redetected almost all of these pulsars and provide new dispersion measure values and flux densities at 20 cm for the redetected pulsars.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/446,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey: PSR J1811-1736, a Pulsar in a Highly Eccentric Binary System","We are undertaking a high-frequency survey of the Galactic plane for radio pulsars, using the 13-element multibeam receiver on the 64-m Parkes radio telescope. We describe briefly the survey system and some of the initial results. PSR J1811−1736, one of the first pulsars discovered with this system, has a rotation period of 104 ms. Subsequent timing observations using the 76-m radio telescope at Jodrell Bank show that it is in an 18.8-d, highly eccentric binary orbit. We have measured the rate of advance of periastron which indicates a total system mass of 2.6±0.9 M⊙, and the minimum companion mass is about 0.7 M⊙. This, the high orbital eccentricity and the recycled nature of the pulsar suggest that this system is composed of two neutron stars, only the fourth or fifth such system known in the disc of the Galaxy.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/465,,,,,,,,,,,

Many Routes to Turbulent Convection,"Using automated laser-Doppler methods we have identified four distinct sequences of instabilities leading to turbulent convection at low Prandtl number (2·5–5·0), in fluid layers of small horizontal extent. Contour maps of the structure of the time-averaged velocity field, in conjunction with high-resolution power spectral analysis, demonstrate that several mean flows are stable over a wide range in the Rayleigh number R, and that the sequence of time-dependent instabilities depends on the mean flow. A number of routes to non-periodic motion have been identified by varying the geometrical aspect ratio, Prandtl number, and mean flow. Quasi-periodic motion at two frequencies leads to phase locking or entrainment, as identified by a step in a graph of the ratio of the two frequencies. The onset of non-periodicity in this case is associated with the loss of entrainment as R is increased. Another route to turbulence involves successive subharmonic (or period doubling) bifurcations of a periodic flow. A third route contains a well-defined regime with three generally incommensurate frequencies and no broadband noise. The spectral analysis used to demonstrate the presence of three frequencies has a precision of about one part in 104 to 105. Finally, we observe a process of intermittent non-periodicity first identified by Libchaber & Maurer at lower Prandtl number. In this case the fluid alternates between quasi-periodic and non-periodic states over a finite range in R. Several of these processes are also manifested by rather simple mathematical models, but the complicated dependence on geometrical parameters, Prandtl number, and mean flow structure has not been explained.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/342,,,,,,,,,,,

"Radio-gamma-ray Connection and Spectral Evolution in 4C+49.22 (S4 1150+49): the Fermi, Swift and Planck View","The Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected a strong γ-ray flare on 2011 May 15 from a source identified as 4C +49.22, a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) also known as S4 1150+49. This blazar, characterized by a prominent radio–optical–X-ray jet, was in a low γ-ray activity state during the first years of Fermi observations. Simultaneous observations during the quiescent, outburst and post-flare γ-ray states were obtained by Swift, Planck and optical–IR–radio telescopes (Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica, Catalina Sky Survey, Very Long Baseline Array [VLBA], Metsähovi). The flare is observed from microwave to X-ray bands with correlated variability and the Fermi, Swift and Planck data for this FSRQ show some features more typical of BL Lac objects, like the synchrotron peak in the optical band that outshines the thermal blue-bump emission, and the X-ray spectral softening. Multi-epoch VLBA observations show the ejection of a new component close in time with the GeV γ-ray flare. The radio-to-γ-ray spectral energy distribution is modelled and fitted successfully for the outburst and the post-flare epochs using either a single flaring blob with two emission processes (synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), and external-radiation Compton), and a two-zone model with SSC-only mechanism.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/341,,,,,,,,,,,

When the charge on a planar conductor is a function of its curvature,"While there is no general relationship between the electric charge density on a conductingsurface and its curvature, the two quantities can be functionally related in special circumstances. This paper presents a complete classification of two-dimensional conductors for which charge density is a function of boundary curvature. Whenever the curvature function is non-injective, the conductor must transform under one of the planar symmetry groups. In particular, for the charge density on a closed conductor with smooth boundary to be a function of its curvature, the conductor must possess dihedral symmetry with a mirror line running through each curvature extremum. Several examples are presented along with explicit charge-curvature functions. Both increasing and decreasing functions were found.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/358,,,,,,,,,,,

X-ray and Gamma-ray Studies of the Millisecond Pulsar and Possible X-ray/Radio Pulsar Transition Object PSR J1723-2837,"We present X-ray observations of the ""redback"" eclipsing radio millisecond pulsar (MSP) and candidate radio pulsar/X-ray binary transition object PSR J1723-2837. The X-ray emission from the system is predominantly non-thermal and exhibits pronounced variability as a function of orbital phase, with a factor of ~2 reduction in brightness around superior conjunction. Such temporal behavior appears to be a defining characteristic of this variety of peculiar MSP binaries and is likely caused by a partial geometric occultation by the main-sequence-like companion of a shock within the binary. There is no indication of diffuse X-ray emission from a bow shock or pulsar wind nebula associated with the pulsar. We also report on a search for point source emission and γ-ray pulsations in Fermi Large Area Telescope data using a likelihood analysis and photon probability weighting. Although PSR J1723-2837 is consistent with being a γ-ray point source, due to the strong Galactic diffuse emission at its position a definitive association cannot be established. No statistically significant pulsations or modulation at the orbital period are detected. For a presumed detection, the implied γ-ray luminosity is 5% of its spin-down power. This indicates that PSR J1723-2837 is either one of the least efficient γ-ray producing MSPs or, if the detection is spurious, the γ-ray emission pattern is not directed toward us.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/369,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rheology of soft colloids across the onset of rigidity: scaling behavior, thermal, and non-thermal responses","We study the rheological behavior of colloidal suspensions composed of soft sub-micron-size hydrogel particles across the liquid-solid transition. The measured stress and strain-rate data, when normalized by thermal stress and time scales, suggest our systems reside in a regime wherein thermal effects are important. In a different vein, critical point scaling predictions for the jamming transition, typical in athermal systems, are tested. Near dynamic arrest, the suspensions exhibit scaling exponents similar to those reported in Nordstrom et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2010, 105, 175701. The observation suggests that our system exhibits a glass transition near the onset of rigidity, but it also exhibits a jamming-like scaling further from the transition point. These observations are thought-provoking in light of recent theoretical and simulation findings, which show that suspension rheology across the full range of microgel particle experiments can exhibit both thermal and athermal mechanisms.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/278,,,,,,,,,,,
Adiabatic Quantum Simulation of Quantum Chemistry,"We show how to apply the quantum adiabatic algorithm directly to the quantum computation of molecular properties. We describe a procedure to map electronic structure Hamiltonians to 2-body qubit Hamiltonians with a small set of physically realizable couplings. By combining the Bravyi-Kitaev construction to map fermions to qubits with perturbative gadgets to reduce the Hamiltonian to 2-body, we obtain precision requirements on the coupling strengths and a number of ancilla qubits that scale polynomially in the problem size. Hence our mapping is efficient. The required set of controllable interactions includes only two types of interaction beyond the Ising interactions required to apply the quantum adiabatic algorithm to combinatorial optimization problems. Our mapping may also be of interest to chemists directly as it defines a dictionary from electronic structure to spin Hamiltonians with physical interactions.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/293,,,,,,,,,,,

Planck 2013 results. V. LFI calibration,"We discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the data acquired by the Low Frequency Instrument on Planck. Our calibration is based on a combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectively by the motion of the Planck spacecraft with respect to the Sun and by motion of the solar system with respect to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) rest frame. The latter provides a signal of a few mK with the same spectrum as the CMB anisotropies and is visible throughout the mission. In this data releasewe rely on the characterization of the solar dipole as measured by WMAP. We also present preliminary results (at 44 GHz only) on the study of the Orbital Dipole, which agree with the WMAP value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties. We compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour, in order to keep track of changes in the detectors’ gain. Since non-idealities in the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented a fast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimating the signal generated by the dipole. Moreover, in order to further reduce the impact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variations in the calibration constant of the 30 GHz radiometers (the ones with the largest sidelobes) using the signal of an internal reference load at 4 K instead of the CMB dipole. We have estimated the accuracy of the LFI calibration following two strategies: (1) we have run a set of simulations to assess the impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument and in the calibration procedure; and (2) we have performed a number of internal consistency checks on the data and on the brightness temperature of Jupiter. Errors in the calibration of this Planck/LFI data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 GHz, and 0.8% at 30 GHz. Both these preliminary results at low and high ℓ are consistent with WMAP results within uncertainties and comparison of power spectra indicates good consistency in the absolute calibration with HFI (0.3%) and a 1.4σ discrepancy with WMAP (0.9%).",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/489,,,,,,,,,,,

Planck 2013 results. IV. Low Frequency Instrument beams and window functions,"This paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beam window functions, and the associated uncertainties for the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI). Knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determining the transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropy power spectrum. The main beam distortions affect the beam window function, complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at high multipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles. The in-flight assessment of the LFI main beams relies on the measurements performed during Jupiter observations. By stacking the datafrom multiple Jupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to –20 dB at 30 and 44 GHz, and down to –25 dB at 70 GHz. The main beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.2% at each LFI frequency band. The Planck pre-launch optical model is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of any noise effects. This approach provides an optical model whose beams fully reproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows a description of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by the Jupiter measurements themselves. The agreement between the simulated beams and the measured beams is better than 1% at each LFI frequency band. The simulated beams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effective beams. The error budget for the window functions is estimated from both main beam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes. The total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2% at 30 and 44 GHz, respectively (at ℓ ≈ 600), and 0.7% at 70 GHz (at ℓ ≈ 1000).",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/490,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. II. Low Frequency Instrument data processing,"We describe the data processing pipeline of the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) data processing centre (DPC) to create and characterize full-sky maps based on the first 15.5 months of operations at 30, 44, and 70 GHz. In particular, we discuss the various steps involved in reducing the data, from telemetry packets through to the production of cleaned, calibrated timelines and calibrated frequency maps. Data are continuously calibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation by the proper motion of the spacecraft. Sky signals other than the dipole are removed by an iterative procedure based on simultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. Noise properties are estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed, using a generalized least squares map-making algorithm. A destriping code (Madam) is employed to combine radiometric data and pointing information into sky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. Noise covariance matrices, required to compute statistical uncertainties on LFI and Planck products, are also produced. Main beams are estimated down to the ≈−20 dB level using Jupiter transits, which are also used for the geometrical calibration of the focal plane.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/492,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. XXXI. Consistency of the Planck data,"The Planck design and scanning strategy provide many levels of redundancy that can be exploited to provide tests of internal consistency. One of the most important is the comparison of the 70 GHz (amplifier) and 100 GHz (bolometer) channels. Based on different instrument technologies, with feeds located differently in the focal plane, analysed independently by different teams using different software, and near the minimum of diffuse foreground emission, these channels are in effect two different experiments. The 143 GHz channel has the lowest noise level on Planck, and is near the minimum of unresolved foreground emission. In this paper, we analyse the level of consistency achieved in the 2013 Planck data. We concentrate on comparisons between the 70, 100, and 143 GHz channel maps and power spectra, particularly over the angular scales of the first and second acoustic peaks, on maps masked for diffuse Galactic emission and for strong unresolved sources. Difference maps covering angular scales from 8° to 15′ are consistent with noise, and show no evidence of cosmic microwave background structure. Including small but important corrections for unresolved-source residuals, we demonstrate agreement (measured by deviation of the ratio from unity) between 70 and 100 GHz power spectra averaged over 70 ≤ ℓ ≤ 390 at the 0.8% level, and agreement between 143 and 100 GHz power spectra of 0.4% over the same ℓ range. These values are within and consistent with the overall uncertainties in calibration given in the Planck 2013 results. We also present results based on the 2013 likelihood analysis showing consistency at the 0.35% between the 100, 143, and 217 GHz power spectra. We analyse calibration procedures and beams to determine what fraction of these differences can be accounted for by known approximations or systematicerrors that could be controlled even better in the future, reducing uncertainties still further. Several possible small improvements are described. Subsequent analysis of the beams quantifies the importance of asymmetry in the near sidelobes, which was not fully accounted for initially, affecting the 70/100 ratio. Correcting for this, the 70, 100, and 143 GHz power spectra agree to 0.4% over the first two acoustic peaks. The likelihood analysis that produced the 2013 cosmological parameters incorporated uncertainties larger than this. We show explicitly that correction of the missing near sidelobe power in the HFI channels would result in shifts in the posterior distributions of parameters of less than 0.3σ except for As,",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/478,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. III. LFI systematic uncertainties,"We present the current estimate of instrumental and systematic effect uncertainties for the Planck-Low Frequency Instrument relevant to the first release of the Planckcosmological results. We give an overview of the main effects and of the tools and methods applied to assess residuals in maps and power spectra. We also present an overall budget of known systematic effect uncertainties, which are dominated by sidelobe straylight pick-up and imperfect calibration. However, even these two effects are at least two orders of magnitude weaker than the cosmic microwave background fluctuations as measured in terms of the angular temperature power spectrum. A residual signal above the noise level is present in the multipole range ℓ < 20, most notably at 30 GHz, and is probably caused by residual Galactic straylight contamination. Current analysis aims to further reduce the level of spurious signals in the data and to improve the systematic effects modelling, in particular with respect to straylight and calibration uncertainties.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/491,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. XXI. Power spectrum and high-order statistics of the Planck all-sky Compton parameter map,"We have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithms to the 100 to 857 GHz frequency channel maps from the Planck survey. This map shows an obvious galaxy cluster tSZ signal that is well matched with blindly detected clusters in the Planck SZ catalogue. To characterize the signal in the tSZ map we have computed its angular power spectrum. At large angular scales (ℓ < 60), the major foreground contaminant is the diffuse thermal dust emission. At small angular scales (ℓ > 500) the clustered cosmic infrared background and residual point sources are the major contaminants. These foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted. We thus measure the tSZ power spectrum over angular scales 0.17° ≲ θ ≲ 3.0° that were previously unexplored. The measured tSZ power spectrum is consistent with that expected from the Planck catalogue of SZ sources, with clear evidence of additional signal from unresolved clusters and, potentially, diffuse warm baryons. Marginalized band-powers of the Planck tSZ power spectrum and the best-fit model are given. The non-Gaussianity of the Compton parameter map is further characterized by computing its 1D probability distribution function and its bispectrum. The measured tSZ power spectrum and high order statistics are used to place constraints onσ8.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/481,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. XXII. Constraints on inflation,"We analyse the implications of the Planck data for cosmic inflation. The Planck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with the WMAP large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to be n(s) = 0.9603 +/- 0:0073, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 sigma Planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.11 (95% CL). The Planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standard inflationary models preferring potentials with V '' < 0. Exponential potential models, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential models of degree n >= 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. Planck does not find statistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining dn(s)/dln k = -0.0134 +/- 0.0090. We verify these conclusions through a numerical analysis, which makes no slowroll approximation, and carry out a Bayesian parameter estimation and model-selection analysis for a number of inflationary models including monomial, natural, and hilltop potentials. For each model, we present the Planck constraints on the parameters of the potential and explore several possibilities for the post-inflationary entropy generation epoch, thus obtaining nontrivial data-driven constraints. We also present a direct reconstruction of the observable range of the inflaton potential. Unless a quartic term is allowed in the potential, we find results consistent with second-order slow-roll predictions. We also investigate whether the primordial power spectrum contains any features. We find that models with a parameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit by delta 2 10; however, Bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. We constrain several single-field inflation models with generalized Lagrangians by combining power spectrum data with Planck bounds on fNL. Planck constrains with unprecedented accuracy the amplitude and possible correlation (with the adiabatic mode) of non-decaying isocurvature fluctuations. The fractional primordial contributions of cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature modes of the types expected in the curvaton and axion scenarios have upper bounds of 0.25% and 3.9% (95% CL), respectively. In models with arbitrarily correlated CDM or neutrino isocurvature modes, an anticorrelated isocurvature component can improve the 2 by approximately 4 as a result of slightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the 40 multipoles relative to the higher multipoles. Nonetheless, the data are consistent with adiabatic initial conditions.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/601,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. XX. Cosmology from Sunyaev–Zeldovich cluster counts,"We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass M and SZ signal Y calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power spectrum amplitude σ8 and matter density parameter Ωm in a flat ΛCDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the Y–M relation and the halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to the true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that σ8 = 0.75 ± 0.03, Ωm = 0.29 ± 0.02, and σ8(Ωm/ 0.27)0.3 = 0.764 ± 0.025. The value of σ8 is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value of 20% (the central value from numerical simulations) we find σ8(Ωm/0.27)0.3 = 0.78 ± 0.01 and a tighter one-dimensional range σ8 = 0.77 ± 0.02. We find that the larger values of σ8 and Ωm preferred by Planck’s measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 40%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales relative to the ΛCDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos. We place our results in the context of other determinations of cosmologicalparameters, and discuss issues that need to be resolved in order to make further progress in this field.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/482,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. XXX. Cosmic infrared background measurements and implications for star formation,"We present new measurements of cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies using Planck. Combining HFI data with IRAS, the angular auto- and cross-frequency power spectrum is measured from 143 to 3000  GHz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545  GHz. The total areas used to compute the CIB power spectrum and bispectrum are about 2240 and 4400 deg2, respectively. After careful removal of the contaminants (cosmic microwave background anisotropies, Galactic dust, and Sunyaev-Zeldovich emission), and a complete study of systematics, the CIB power spectrum is measured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipoles ℓ ~ 150 to 2500. The bispectrum due to the clustering of dusty, star-forming galaxies is measured from ℓ ~ 130 to 1100, with a total signal to noise ratio of around 6, 19, and 29 at 217, 353, and 545  GHz, respectively. Two approaches are developed for modelling CIB power spectrum anisotropies. The first approach takes advantage of the unique measurements by Planck at large angular scales, and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of dark matter haloes hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by their contribution to the emissivities. The second approach is based on a model that associates star-forming galaxies with dark matter haloes and their subhaloes, using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosity and (sub-)halo mass. The two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. We find that the star formation history is well constrained up to redshifts around 2, and agrees with recent estimates of the obscured star-formation density using Spitzer and Herschel. However, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the star formation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in the spectral energy distribution of CIB galaxies. We also find that the mean halo mass which is most efficient at hosting star formation is log (Meff/M⊙) = 12.6 and that CIB galaxies have warmer temperatures as redshift increases. The CIB bispectrum is steeper than that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a power law; this gives some information about the contribution of massive haloes to the CIB bispectrum. Finally, we show that the same halo occupation distribution can fit all power spectra simultaneously. The precise measurements enabled by Planck pose new challenges for the modelling of CIB anisotropies, indicating the power of using CIB anisotropies to understand the process of galaxy formation.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/479,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. XIX. The integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect,"Based on cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the 2013 Planck Mission data release, this paper presents the detection of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, that is, the correlation between the CMB and large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. The significance of detection ranges from 2 to 4σ, depending on which method is used. We investigated three separate approaches, which essentially cover all previous studies, and also break new ground. (i) We correlated the CMB with the Planck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). This detection was made using the lensing-induced bispectrum between the low-ℓ and high-ℓ temperature anisotropies; the correlation between lensing and the ISW effect has a significance close to 2.5σ. (ii) We cross-correlated with tracers of large-scale structure, which yielded a significance of about3σ, based on a combination of radio (NVSS) and optical (SDSS) data. (iii) We used aperture photometry on stacked CMB fields at the locations of known large-scale structures, which yielded and confirms a 4σ signal, over a broader spectral range, when using a previously explored catalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale when compared with expectations. More recent catalogues give more moderate results that range from negligible to 2.5σ at most, but have a more consistent scale and amplitude, the latter being still slightly higher than what is expected from numerical simulations within ΛCMD. Where they can be compared, these measurements are compatible with previous work using data from WMAP, where these scales have been mapped to the limits of cosmic variance. Planck’s broader frequency coverage allows for better foreground cleaning and confirms that the signal is achromatic, which makes it preferable for ISW detection. As a final step we used tracers of large-scale structure to filter the CMB data, from which we present maps of the ISW temperature perturbation. These results provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of a dark energy component that governs the currently accelerated expansion of the Universe.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/484,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. XVII. Gravitational lensing by large-scale structure,"On the arcminute angular scales probed by Planck, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies are gently perturbed by gravitational lensing. Here we present a detailed study of this effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217 GHz frequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25σ. We use thetemperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a (noisy) map of the CMB lensing potential, which provides an integrated measure of the mass distribution back to the CMB last-scattering surface. Our lensing potential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a fact which we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scale structure. We estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, finding generally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting ΛCDM model for the Plancktemperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z = 1100 correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structures which source the lensing potential. When combined with the temperature power spectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameter constraints; it improves CMB-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of two and also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordial perturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing a measurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent of large-scale polarization data. Discarding scale information, our measurement corresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential power spectrum, or a 2% constraint on the root-mean-squared amplitude of matter fluctuations at z ~ 2.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/485,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. XVI. Cosmological parameters,"This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (ℓ ≳ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ∗ = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10-2, Ωbh2 = 0.02205 ± 0.00028, Ωch2 = 0.1199 ± 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 ± 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter,Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter ΛCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002< 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 ± 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/486,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. XV. CMB power spectra and likelihood,"This paper presents the Planck 2013 likelihood, a complete statistical description of the two-point correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations that accounts for all known relevant uncertainties, both instrumental and astrophysical in nature. We use this likelihood to derive our best estimate of the CMB angular power spectrum from Planckover three decades in multipole moment, ℓ, covering 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2500. The main source of uncertainty at ℓ ≲ 1500 is cosmic variance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumental noise dominate the error budget at higher ℓs. For ℓ < 50, our likelihood exploits all Planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 GHz, separating the cosmological CMB signal from diffuse Galactic foregrounds through a physically motivated Bayesian component separation technique. At ℓ ≥ 50, we employ a correlated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on a fine-grained set of angular cross-spectra derived from multiple detector combinations between the 100, 143, and 217 GHz frequency channels, marginalising over power spectrum foreground templates. We validate our likelihood through an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact of residual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on the final cosmological parameters. We find good internal agreement among the high-ℓ cross-spectra with residuals below a few μK2 at ℓ ≲ 1000, in agreement with estimated calibration uncertainties. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMB maps derived from all Planck frequencies, as well as with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz Planck map, and find broad agreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. We further show that the best-fit ΛCDMcosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary PlanckEE and TE polarisation spectra. We find that the standard ΛCDM cosmology is well constrained by Planck from the measurements at ℓ ≲ 1500. One specific example is the spectral index of scalar perturbations, for which we report a 5.4σ deviation from scale invariance, ns = 1. Increasing the multipole range beyond ℓ ≃ 1500 does not increase our accuracy for the ΛCDM parameters, but instead allows us to study extensions beyond the standard model. We find no indication of significant departures from the ΛCDM framework. Finally, we report a tension between the Planck best-fit ΛCDM model and the low-ℓ spectrum in the form of a power deficit of 5–10% at ℓ ≲ 40, with a statistical significance of 2.5–3σ. Without a theoretically motivated model for this power deficit, we do not elaborate further on its cosmological",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/487,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. VIII. HFI photometric calibration and mapmaking,"This paper describes the methods used to produce photometrically calibrated maps from the Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) cleaned, time-ordered information. HFI observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857  GHz. To obtain the best calibration accuracy over such a large range, two different photometric calibration schemes have to be used. The 545 and 857 GHz data are calibrated by comparing flux-density measurements of Uranus and Neptune with models of their atmospheric emission. The lower frequencies (below 353  GHz) are calibrated using the solar dipole. A component of this anisotropy is time-variable, owing to the orbital motion of the satellite in the solar system. Photometric calibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses low-frequency noise removal. By comparing observations taken more than one year apart in the same configuration, we have identified apparent gain variations with time. These variations are induced by non-linearities in the read-out electronics chain. We have developed an effective correction to limit their effect on calibration. We present several methods to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. We distinguish relative uncertainties (between detectors, or between frequencies) and absolute uncertainties. Absolute uncertainties lie in the range from 0.54% to 10% from 100 to 857  GHz. We describe the pipeline used to produce the maps from the HFI timelines, based on the photometric calibration parameters, and the scheme used to set the zero level of the maps a posteriori. We also discuss the cross-calibration between HFI and the SPIRE instrument on board Herschel. Finally we summarize the basic characteristics of the set of HFI maps included in the 2013 Planck data release.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/483,,,,,,,,,,,
Planck 2013 results. VII. HFI time response and beams,"This paper characterizes the effective beams, the effective beam window functions and the associated errors for the Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) detectors. The effective beam is theangular response including the effect of the optics, detectors, data processing and the scan strategy. The window function is the representation of this beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiased measurement of the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. The HFI is a scanning instrument and its effective beams are the convolution of: a) the optical response of the telescope and feeds; b) the processing of the time-ordered data and deconvolution of the bolometric and electronic transfer function; and c) the merging of several surveys to produce maps. The time response transfer functions are measured using observations of Jupiter and Saturn and by minimizing survey difference residuals. The scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angular response of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of Mars. The main beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each HFI frequency band. Observations of Jupiter and Saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5°) to about 0.1% of the total solid angle. Time response residuals remain as long tails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total solid angle. The bias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles of simulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise and known systematic effects. The correlation structure of these ensembles is well-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to sample variance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. A suite of consistency tests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficient description of the data. The total error in the effective beam window functions is below 1% at 100 GHz up to multipole ℓ ~ 1500, and below 0.5% at 143 and 217 GHz up to ℓ ~ 2000.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/488,,,,,,,,,,,

The Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources,"The Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS) is the catalogue of sources detected in the first 15 months of Planck operations, the “nominal” mission. It consists of nine single-frequency catalogues of compact sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the entire sky. The PCCS covers the frequency range 30–857 GHz with higher sensitivity (it is 90% complete at 180 mJy in the best channel) and better angular resolution (from 32.88′ to 4.33′) than previous all-sky surveys in this frequency band. By construction its reliability is >80% and more than 65% of the sources have been detected in at least two contiguous Planck channels.

Planck 2013 results. I. Overview of products and scientific results,"The European Space Agency’s Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter ΛCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25σ. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck’s results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations (σ8) derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis ofPlanck polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of E-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/493,,,,,,,,,,,

An improved method for object detection in astronomical images,"This paper introduces an improved method for detecting objects of interest (galaxies and stars) in astronomical images. After applying a global detection scheme, further refinement is applied by dividing the entire image into several irregularly sized sub-regions using the watershed segmentation method. A more refined detection procedure is performed in each sub-region by applying adaptive noise reduction and a layered strategy to detect bright objects and faint objects, respectively. Finally, a multi-threshold technique is used to separate blended objects. On simulated data, this method can detect more real objects than SExtractor at comparable object counts (91 per cent versus 83 per cent true detections) and has an increased chance of successfully detecting very faint objects, up to 2 mag fainter than SExtractor on similar data. Our method has also been applied to real observational image data sets to verify its effectiveness.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/626,,,,,,,,,,,

The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Lensing of CMB Temperature and Polarization Derived from Cosmic Infrared Background Cross-Correlation,"We present a measurement of the gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization fields obtained by cross-correlating the reconstructed convergence signal from the first season of Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter data at 146 GHz with Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) fluctuations measured using the Planck satellite. Using an effective overlap area of 92.7 square degrees, we detect gravitational lensing of the CMB polarization by large-scale structure at a statistical significance of 4.5 sigma. Combining both CMB temperature and polarization data gives a lensing detection at 9.1 sigma significance. A B-mode polarization lensing signal is present with a significance of 3.2 sigma. We also present the first measurement of CMB lensing-CIB correlation at small scales corresponding to l > 2000. Null tests and systematic checks show that our results are not significantly biased by astrophysical or instrumental systematic effects, including Galactic dust. Fitting our measurements to the best-fit lensing-CIB cross-power spectrum measured in Planck data, scaled by an amplitude A, gives A = 1.02(-0.08)(+0.12)(stat.) +/- 0.06(syst.), consistent with the Planck results.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/624,,,,,,,,,,,
Flagellar Kinematics and Swimming of Algal Cells in Viscoelastic Fluids,"The motility of microorganisms is influenced greatly by their hydrodynamic interactions with the fluidic environment they inhabit. We show by direct experimental observation of the bi-flagellated alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that fluid elasticity and viscosity strongly influence the beating pattern - the gait - and thereby control the propulsion speed. The beating frequency and the wave speed characterizing the cyclical bending are both enhanced by fluid elasticity. Despite these enhancements, the net swimming speed of the alga is hindered for fluids that are sufficiently elastic. The origin of this complex response lies in the interplay between the elasticity-induced changes in the spatial and temporal aspects of the flagellar cycle and the buildup and subsequent relaxation of elastic stresses during the power and recovery strokes.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/600,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence of Lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background by Dark Matter Halos,We present evidence of the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background by 1013 solar mass dark matter halos. Lensing convergence maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) are stacked at the positions of around 12 000 optically selected CMASS galaxies from the SDSS-III/BOSS survey. The mean lensing signal is consistent with simulated dark matter halo profiles and is favored over a null signal at 3.2σsignificance. This result demonstrates the potential of microwave background lensing to probe the dark matter distribution in galaxy group and galaxy cluster halos.,https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/623,,,,,,,,,,,

First measurement of the cross-correlation of CMB lensing and galaxy lensing,"We measure the cross-correlation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing convergence maps derived from Atacama Cosmology Telescope data with galaxy lensing convergence maps as measured by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey. The CMB-galaxy lensing cross power spectrum is measured for the first time with a significance of 4.2 sigma, which corresponds to a 12% constraint on the amplitude of density fluctuations at redshifts similar to 0.9. With upcoming improved lensing data, this novel type of measurement will become a powerful cosmological probe, providing a precise measurement of the mass distribution at intermediate redshifts and serving as a calibrator for systematic biases in weak lensing measurements.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/586,,,,,,,,,,,

The Physical Origin of Torque and of the Rotational Second Law,"We derive the rotational form of Newton's second law tau = I alpha from the translational form (F) over right arrow = m (a) over right arrow by performing a force analysis of a simple body consisting of two discrete masses. Curiously, a truly rigid body model leads to an incorrect statement of the rotational second law. The failure of this model is traced to its violation of the strong form of Newton's third law. This leads us to consider a slightly modified non-rigid model that respects the third law, produces the correct rotational second law, and makes explicit the importance of the product of the tangential force with the radial distance: the torque.

On the chaotic behavior of the satellite hyperion,"We model the longitudinal librations of Hyperion with a second order nonlinear differential equation in which the terms of order e 2 or higher, where e is the eccentricity of the satellite's elliptical orbit, are neglected. With a suitable change of variable we transform the differential equation into an equivalent one that describes the motion of a forced pendulum with a vertically oscillating pivot. We prove that the pendulum has uncountably many chaotic orbits. Hence, the proposed model indicates, although it does not prove, that Hyperion's longitudinal librations are chaotic.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/539,,,,,,,,,,,

Completing the Lienard-Wiechert potentials: The origin of the delta function fields for a charged particle in hyperbolic motion,"Calculating the electromagnetic fields of a uniformly accelerated charged particle is a surprisingly subtle problem that has been long discussed in the literature. In particular, the fields calculated from the Liénard-Wiechert potentials fail to satisfy Maxwell's equations. While the correct fields have been obtained many times and through various means, it has remained unclear why the standard approach fails. We identify and amend the faulty step in the Liénard-Wiechert construction and provide a new direct calculation of the fields and potentials for acharge in hyperbolic motion.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/599,,,,,,,,,,,

Planck intermediate results XXV. The Andromeda galaxy as seen by Planck,"The Andromeda galaxy (M 31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficient angular size on the sky to be resolved by the Planck satellite. Planck has detected M 31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dust emission with the High Frequency Instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiral arms and sub-features. We examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dust emission as seen by Planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, and investigate the dust heating mechanism across M 31. We find that dust dominating the longer wavelength emission (greater than or similar to 0.3 mm) is heated by the diffuse stellar population (as traced by 3.6 mu m emission), with the dust dominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellar population and star-forming regions (as traced by 24 mu m emission). We also fit spectral energy distributions for individual 5' pixels and quantify the dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these different heating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature with galactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as would be expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22 K in the nucleus to 14 K outside of the 10 kpc ring. Finally, we measure the integrated spectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a global dust temperature of (18.2 +/- 1.0) K with a spectral index of 1.62 +/- 0.11 (assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-free emission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60 GHz, which corresponds to a star formation rate of around 0.12 M-circle dot yr(-1). We find a 2.3 sigma detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a 30 GHz amplitude of 0.7 +/- 0.3 Jy, which is in line with expectations from our Galaxy.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/628,,,,,,,,,,,
The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: measuring radio galaxy bias through cross-correlation with lensing,"We correlate the positions of radio galaxies in the FIRST survey with the cosmic microwave background lensing convergence estimated from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope over 470 deg2 to determine the bias of these galaxies. We remove optically cross-matched sources below redshiftz = 0.2 to preferentially select active galactic nuclei (AGN). We measure the angular cross-power spectrum Cκgl at 4.4σ significance in the multipole range 100 < l < 3000, corresponding to physical scales within ≈2–60 Mpc at an effective redshift zeff = 1.5. Modelling the AGN population with a redshift-dependent bias, the cross-spectrum is well fitted by the Planck best-fitting Λ cold dark matter cosmological model. Fixing the cosmology and assumed redshift distribution of sources, we fit for the overall bias model normalization, finding b(zeff) = 3.5 ± 0.8 for the full galaxy sample and b(zeff) = 4.0 ± 1.1(3.0 ± 1.1) for sources brighter (fainter) than 2.5 mJy. This measurement characterizes the typical halo mass of radio-loud AGN: we find log(Mhalo/M⊙)=13.6+0.3−0.4.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/627,,,,,,,,,,,

Joint Analysis of BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck Data,"We report the results of a joint analysis of data from BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck. BICEP2 and Keck Array have observed the same approximately 400 deg(2) patch of sky centered on RA 0 h, Dec. -57.5 degrees. The combined maps reach a depth of 57 nK deg in Stokes Q and U in a band centered at 150 GHz. Planck has observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353 GHz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 mu K deg in Q and U at 143 GHz). We detect 150 x 353 cross-correlation in B modes at high significance. We fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra at frequencies >= 150 GHz to a lensed-Lambda CDM model that includes dust and a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (as parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r), using a prior on the frequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous Planck analysis of other regions of the sky. We find strong evidence for dust and no statistically significant evidence for tensor modes. We probe various model variations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component in combination with lower frequency data, and find that these make little difference to the r constraint. Finally, we present an alternative analysis which is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and show that this gives similar constraints. The final result is expressed as a likelihood curve for r, and yields an upper limit r(0.05) < 0.12 at 95% confidence. Marginalizing over dust and r, lensing B modes are detected at 7.0 sigma significance.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/588,,,,,,,,,,,

A natural lattice ordering on k-families is defined and analyzed, and a number of strong intersection properties are obtained. Finally, thek-families of P are used to define a class of submodular set functions on P, which can be used to generalize a number of results in transversal theory.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/mathematics_facpubs/171,,,,,,,,,,,

Rational Seifert Surfaces in Seifert Filtered Spaces,"Rationally null-homologous links in Seifert fibered spaces may be represented combinatorially via labeled diagrams. We introduce an additional condition on a labeled link diagram and prove that it is equivalent to the existence of a rational Seifert surface for the link. In the case when this condition is satisfied, we generalize Seifert's algorithm to explicitly construct a rational Seifert surface for any rationally null-homologous link. As an application of the techniques developed in the paper, we derive closed formulae for the rational Thurston-Bennequin and rotation numbers of a rationally null-homologous Legendrian knot in a contact Seifert fibered space. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/mathematics_facpubs/94,,,,,,,,,,,

Spectral Properties of the Reflection Operator in Two Dimensions,"We study spectral properties of the reflection operator (a singular integral operator arising naturally in connection with the radiosity equation which models the energy transfer between different parts of a surface by radiation) acting on L p spaces, p ∈ (1, ∞), on infinite angles in two dimensions. More specifically we establish an explicit characterization of the spectrum and spectral radius estimates for the reflection operator acting on L p spaces on an infinite angle in two dimensions. This type of analysis is relevant to the solvability of the radiosity equation with L p data since when the spectral radius is < 1, the solution can be explicitly expressed as a convergent Neumann series.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/mathematics_facpubs/229,,,,,,,,,,,

Threat Analysis and the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee,"Because of its dynamic nature, those confronting the al-Qaeda threat must follow its evolution very closely. As demonstrated here, this task is particularly challenging when counterterrorism is carried out under the aegis of international organizations. This article explores the threat identification function of the al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee (also known as the 1267 Committee) charged with supervising the UN sanctions regime against al-Qaeda and its associates. Examination of the role of threat identification in the committee's work, and of the content of the threat analysis presented in the periodic reports of its subsidiary monitoring team, suggests the marginality of strategic threat assessment and underscores the constraints created by bureaucratic and political factors. The article also demonstrates the failure of the Committee and the monitoring team to thoroughly engage in central questions regarding al-Qaeda's nature, objectives, and organizational strategy.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/polisci_facpubs/167,,,,,,,,,,,

The al Qaeda Franchise: The Expansion of al-Qaeda and Its Consequences,"The al-Qaeda Franchise asks why al-Qaeda adopted a branching-out strategy, introducing seven franchises spread over the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. After all, transnational terrorist organizations can expand through other organizational strategies. Forming franchises was not an inevitable outgrowth of al-Qaeda's ideology or its U.S.-focused strategy. The efforts to create local franchises have also undermined one of al-Qaeda's primary achievements: the creation of a transnational entity based on religious, not national, affiliation. The book argues that al-Qaeda's branching out strategy was not a sign of strength, but instead a response to its decline in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Franchising reflected an escalation of al-Qaeda's commitments in response to earlier strategic mistakes, leaders' hubris, and its diminished capabilities. Although the introduction of new branches helped al-Qaeda create a frightening image far beyond its actual capabilities, ultimately this strategy neither increased the al-Qaeda threat, nor enhanced the organization's political objectives. In fact, the rise of ISIS from an al-Qaeda branch to the dominant actor in the jihadi camp demonstrates how expansion actually incurred heavy costs for al-Qaeda. The al-Qaeda Franchise goes beyond explaining the adoption of a branching out strategy, also exploring particular expansion choices. Through nine case studies, it analyzes why al-Qaeda formed branches in some arenas but not others, and why its expansion in some locations, such as Yemen, took the form of in-house franchising (with branches run by al-Qaeda's own fighters), while other locations, such as Iraq and Somalia, involved merging with groups already operating in the target arena. It ends with an assessment of al-Qaeda's future in light of the turmoil in the Middle East, the ascendance of ISIS, and US foreign policy.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/polisci_facpubs/255,,,,,,,,,,,

Uniform Refraction in Negative Refractive Index Materials,"We study the problem of constructing an optical surface separating two homogeneous, isotropic media, one of which has a negative refractive index. In doing so, we develop a vector form of Snell’s law, which is used to study surfaces possessing a certain uniform refraction property, in both the near- and far-field cases. In the near-field problem, unlike the case when both materials have positive refractive indices, we show that the resulting surfaces can be neither convex nor concave.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/mathematics_facpubs/228,,,,,,,,,,,

Structure analysis of collagen fibril at atomic-level resolution and its implications for intra-fibrillar transport in bone biomineralization,"Bone is a hierarchical biocomposite material in which a collagen fibril matrix self-assembled in a three-dimensional (3-D) pseudohexagonal array controls many important processes in mineralization such as providing the pathways by which calcium and phosphate species are delivered and a template for the earliest nucleation sites, determining the spatial distribution of the mineral and the topology for binding of associated non-collagenous proteins. However, the structural characteristics of collagen molecules in the fibril remain unclear at the atomic level. Here we performed the first large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to provide a comprehensive all-atom structural analysis of the entire fibril of Type I collagen including intra-fibrillar water distribution. We found that the ideal fibril structure is preserved in specific sites where the earliest nucleation occurs, but is severely distorted in areas that mineralize later. In detail, the ideal pseudohexagonal structure is well-preserved in the overlap zone (c1, c2 and b bands), in the a bands of the hole zone but is severely distorted at the hole/overlap transition (d and c3 bands). As a result, the expected uniform ""channel,'' formed by connecting holes in adjacent unit cells along the b-axis, and having dimensions of 1.5 nm height along the a-axis and width of 40 nm along the c-axis is not formed. The expected uniform channel of 1.5 nm height is preserved only in the a bands in a narrow sub-channel region only 5.8 nm wide. At the hole/overlap transition, an irregular, tortuous sub-channel of widely varying dimensions (similar to 1.8-4.0 nm height x similar to 3.0 nm width) is formed. The well-defined sub-channel in the a bands along with their preferred orientation of charged amino acid residues could facilitate faster molecular diffusion than the tortuous sub-channels and ionic interactions, thus providing the first nucleation sites. Intra-fibrillar water occupies nano-spaces and shows low density (similar to 0.7 g cm(-3)), which should promote dehydration of ion species. These results provide the first atomic-level understanding of the structure of the collagen fibril and the properties of the aqueous compartments within the fibril, which offer a physical, chemical and steric explanation for calcium phosphate infiltration paths and for the initiation of mineralization at the a band collagen fibril. The mechanism revealed here for the observed specificity of collagen biomineralization in bone formation ultimately contributes to the biochemical and biomechanical functions of the skeleton.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/401,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterizing Accreting Double White Dwarf Binaries with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and Gai,"We demonstrate a method to fully characterize mass-transferring double white dwarf (DWD) systems with a helium-rich (He) white dwarf (WD) donor based on the mass-radius (M-R) relationship for He WDs. Using a simulated Galactic population of DWDs, we show that donor and accretor masses can be inferred for up to similar to 60 systems observed by both Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Gaia. Half of these systems will have mass constraints Delta M-D less than or similar to 0.2 M-circle dot and Delta M-A less than or similar to 2.3 M-circle dot. We also show how the orbital frequency evolution due to astrophysical processes and gravitational radiation can be decoupled from the total orbital frequency evolution for up to similar to 50 of these systems.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/astronomy_facpubs/510,,,,,,,,,,,

We will utilize a classification of these space-times based on the actions of isometry groups on these manifolds. Several exact solutions of the Einstein equations will be derived. The possibilities of dimensional reduction and isotropization will be examined. Five-dimensional generalizations of the mixmaster universe will be developed. Finally, the Einstein equations in 4+1 dimensions will be viewed as a Hamiltonian system. The absence of chaotic solutions to these equations will be shown.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/519,,,,,,,,,,,

Equality and Equivocation: Saving Sovereignty from Itself,"Law and sovereignty are equivocal terms with competing definitions. Sovereignty can refer to coercive state power or a human being's right to self-determination. In international law sovereignty usually means legalized state autonomy, but that definition is misleading, as state power relies either on domination or cooperation in order to 'feel' like sovereignty. Agambe's analysis of sovereignty as the ""œnomos of the west"" gives us the hard case against saying sovereignty can stand also for human self-determination. But his definitions of law and sovereignty are too narrow to sustain his theory. Constable's meditation on the silence of justice in modern law counters Agamben, and demonstrates why sovereignty, despite its ties to coercive state power, still holds out resources of freedom and self-determination that no one can afford to forego. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/pjhr_facpubs/5,,,,,,,,,,,

Trigonal Bi- and Monopyramidal Cobalt(II) Complexes of a Novel Guanidine-Based tripodclassical Ligand,"This is the first of several planned paper describing the coordination chemistry of the novel ligand DIG3tren. We show by X-ray crystallography (performed in collaboration with Glenn Yap at the University of Delaware), mass spectrometry and UV/vis spectroscopy that the DIG3tren ligand coordinates to cobalt by 4 nitrogen atoms (one at the bottom and three equally-spaced around the middle) and has isopropyl 'flaps' that can close over the top of the cobalt atom, or can swing open to allow binding by a small auxiliary ligand such as acetate. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/214,,,,,,,,,,,
Toward the development of peptide nanofilaments and nanoropes as smart materials,"Peptide sequences designed to self-assemble into filaments are shown to form the predicted structures, based on ultracentrifuge, atomic force microscope, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism data.  The design uses phased hydrophobic interactions to drive self assembly, circumventing problems seen in previous approaches that used electrostatics as a driving force. --author-supplied description",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/237,,,,,,,,,,,

A New Sample of Cool Subdwarfs from SDSS: Properties and Kinematics,"We present a new sample of M subdwarfs compiled from the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With 3517 new subdwarfs, this new sample significantly increases the number of spectroscopically confirmed low-mass subdwarfs. This catalog also includes 905 extreme and 534 ultra sudwarfs. We present the entire catalog, including observed and derived quantities, and template spectra created from co-added subdwarf spectra. We show color–color and reduced proper motion diagrams of the three metallicity classes, which are shown to separate from the disk dwarf population. The extreme and ultra subdwarfs are seen at larger values of reduced proper motion, as expected for more dynamically heated populations. We determine 3D kinematics for all of the stars with proper motions. The color–magnitude diagrams show a clear separation of the three metallicity classes with the ultra and extreme subdwarfs being significantly closer to the main sequence than the ordinary subdwarfs. All subdwarfs lie below (fainter) and to the left (bluer) of the main sequence. Based on the average (U, V, W) velocities and their dispersions, the extreme and ultra subdwarfs likely belong to the Galactic halo, while the ordinary subdwarfs are likely part of the old Galactic (or thick) disk. An extensive activity analysis of subdwarfs is performed using Hα emission, and 208 active subdwarfs are found. We show that while the activity fraction of subdwarfs rises with spectral class and levels off at the latest spectral classes, consistent with the behavior of M dwarfs, the extreme and ultra subdwarfs are basically flat.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/psychology_facpubs/314,,,,,,,,,,,

Digging for the Disappeared: Forensic Science After Atrocity,"The mass graves from our long human history of genocide, massacres, and violent conflict form an underground map of atrocity that stretches across the planet's surface. In the past few decades, due to rapidly developing technologies and a powerful global human rights movement, the scientific study of those graves has become a standard facet of post-conflict international assistance. Digging for the Disappeared provides readers with a window into this growing but little-understood form of human rights work, including the dangers and sometimes unexpected complications that arise as evidence is gathered and the dead are named.Adam Rosenblatt examines the ethical, political, and historical foundations of the rapidly growing field of forensic investigation, from the graves of the ""disappeared"" in Latin America to genocides in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia to post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. In the process, he illustrates how forensic teams strive to balance the needs of war crimes tribunals, transitional governments, and the families of the missing in post-conflict nations. Digging for the Disappeareddraws on interviews with key players in the field to present a new way to analyze and value the work forensic experts do at mass graves, shifting the discussion from an exclusive focus on the rights of the living to a rigorous analysis of the care of the dead. Rosenblatt tackles these heady, hard topics in order to extend human rights scholarship into the realm of the dead and the limited but powerful forms of repair available for victims of atrocity.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/pjhr_facpubs/35,,,,,,,,,,,

The Shooting of a Caregiver,"My article, ""The Shooting of a Caregiver,"" was published by The Good Men Project. A reflection on the shooting of Charles Kinsey, a black behavioral therapist, on the North Miami street where he was attempting to help an autistic and intellectually disabled resident of the group home where he works, the piece differs from the commentary that immediately followed the shooting by highlighting Kinsey’s role as a caregiver (therapist, father, and community organizer). I argue that “we all live in, and co-create, a society where disability, and the relationships of care that it fosters, are hidden from view.”",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/pjhr_facpubs/38,,,,,,,,,,,

Civic Engagement with the Dead: Notes on Theory and Practice in a Forensic Key,"Educators and researchers who study human rights face a climate that is often hostile to “theory,” whether due to market forces impacting higher education or a political climate (at least in the United States) that seems to demand urgent action over contemplation. Based on reflections from classroom teaching and longstanding research into the scientific investigations of mass graves after atrocity, this essay acknowledges the entrenchment of the theory/ practice divide within what Charli Carpenter calls “the human rights network,” despite important forms of interdependence between spheres of academia and advocacy. It argues that bridging the theory/practice divide productively requires more than the familiar conference panels and dialogues between scholars and practioners. Using the example of Philadelphia’s Mount Moriah Cemetery, it points to overlooked sites where new forms of engagement are possible: across the divide that separates theory from practice, and also the living from the dead.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/pjhr_facpubs/42,,,,,,,,,,,

P450 monooxygenase ComJ catalyses side chain phenolic cross-coupling during complestatin biosynthesis,"Complestatin is a non-ribosomal heptapeptide belonging to the glycopeptide antibiotic family that displays anti-complement, anti-HIV integrase, neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic, and antibacterial activities. Development of complestatin as a pharmaceutical agent and biological probe has been stymied by the difficulty in isolating the molecule from its natural source, Streptomyces lavendulae, as well as by the uneconomical and environmentally unfriendly nature of current total synthetic routes. Of particular challenge to the organic chemist is the installation of the biaryl and aryl–ether–aryl linkages that provide complestatin with the structural rigidity responsible for its potent pharmacological properties. Herein, we demonstrate that ComJ, a P450 monooxygenase from the complestatin biosynthetic gene cluster, can catalyse phenolic cross-linking of amino acid side chains in vitro. ComJ acts with high efficiency and low substrate stereoselectivity, a finding which paves the way towards the use of ComJ as a biocatalyst for the chemo-enzymatic synthesis of complestatin and other related molecules. The ability of ComJ to accept peptides of alternative stereochemistries raises intriguing questions about the evolutionary origins of glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis and the capacity of S. lavendulae to produce different conformations of complestatin.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/chemistry_facpubs/399,,,,,,,,,,,
Multiliteracies in World Language Education,"Putting a multiliteracies framework at the center of the world language curriculum, this volume brings together college-level curricular innovations and classroom projects that address differences in meaning and worldviews expressed in learners’ primary and target languages. Offering a rich understanding of languages, genres, and modalities as socioculturally situated semiotic systems, it advocates an effective pedagogy for developing learners’ abilities to operate between languages. Chapters showcase curricula that draw on a multiliteracies framework and present various classroom projects that develop aspects of multiliteracies for language learners.
A discussion of the theoretical background and historical development of the pedagogy of multiliteracies and its relevance to the field of world language education positions this book within the broader literature on foreign language education. As developments in globalization, accountability, and austerity challenge contemporary academia and the current structure of world language programs, this book shows how the implementation of a multiliteracies-based approach brings coherence to language programs, and how the framework can help to accomplish the goals of higher education in general and of language education in particular.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/spanish_facpubs/98,,,,,,,,,,,

"The GAPS Experiment: Hunting for Dark Matter with Antideuterons, Proceedings of 33rd International Cosmic Ray Conference","The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) experiment is an indirect dark matter search that aims to detect low-energy antideuterons resulting from dark matter annihilations in the galactic halo. This signature, which has negligible conventional astrophysical background, is predicted by many models of both supersymmetry and extra-dimensional theories. Until now, an optimized low-energy search experiment has been lacking. In this contribution, the scientific and experimental case for GAPS will be reviewed, and its complementarity with existing indirect and direct search experiments will be discussed. We will describe the design of GAPS, which consists of a time-of-flight system and layers of Si(Li) detectors in a tracking geometry designed specifically for low-energy antideuteron detection. The results of our successful prototype balloon flight (pGAPS), which flew from Japan in June 2012 and met 100% of its mission goals, as well as the path forward to a science flight of GAPS from Antarctica, will be presented.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/364,,,,,,,,,,,

Planck 2013 results. VIII. HFI photometric calibration and mapmaking,"This paper describes the methods used to produce photometrically calibrated maps from the Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) cleaned, time-ordered information. HFI observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857  GHz. To obtain the best calibration accuracy over such a large range, two different photometric calibration schemes have to be used. The 545 and 857 GHz data are calibrated by comparing flux-density measurements of Uranus and Neptune with models of their atmospheric emission. The lower frequencies (below 353  GHz) are calibrated using the solar dipole. A component of this anisotropy is time-variable, owing to the orbital motion of the satellite in the solar system. Photometric calibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses low-frequency noise removal. By comparing observations taken more than one year apart in the same configuration, we have identified apparent gain variations with time. These variations are induced by non-linearities in the read-out electronics chain. We have developed an effective correction to limit their effect on calibration. We present several methods to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. We distinguish relative uncertainties (between detectors, or between frequencies) and absolute uncertainties. Absolute uncertainties lie in the range from 0.54% to 10% from 100 to 857  GHz. We describe the pipeline used to produce the maps from the HFI timelines, based on the photometric calibration parameters, and the scheme used to set the zero level of the maps a posteriori. We also discuss the cross-calibration between HFI and the SPIRE instrument on board Herschel. Finally we summarize the basic characteristics of the set of HFI maps included in the 2013 Planck data release.",https://scholarship.haverford.edu/physics_facpubs/477,,,,,,,,,,,

Sihong Xie: Pulling back the curtain on the intelligence behind AI,"If algorithms are going to impact nearly every aspect of our lives, they should meet the highest standards of accountability. Yet little is known—particularly to those outside the field of computer science—about how these algorithms actually operate. Making this form of artificial intelligence more transparent to the lay audience is the driving force behind the work of Lehigh University faculty member Sihong Xie. “Creating accountable machine learning is the ultimate goal of our research,” he says.
