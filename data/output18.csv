Financial Inclusion of Migrant Workers in Singapore," Singapore is one of the largest hosting countries of migrant workers in the world, with up to 1.4 million migrant workers, mainly hailing from Southeast Asian countries with less opportunities for high-paying employment like the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. This population, and the remittances they send, are crucial to the economies of both the host country and the home country, not to mention the individual families that rely on the steady incomes earned abroad and sent home. Historically, migrant workers (MWs) have very little access to financial services; the majority are unbanked and rely on black market providers which specifically target migrants for short-term loans and remittances. However, cross-border money transfer is an intricate, heavily-regulated industry with many actors, and recently is gaining much attention given the increasing financial transactions each year and subsequent profit opportunity for any who can facilitate those transactions. This research seeks to examine the current status, barriers, and potential solutions of the financial inclusion of migrant workers in Singapore, in the context of migrant workers throughout Asia. First, what is the extent of MWs’ financial inclusion or lack thereof, and what measurable impact does that have on their lives in terms of economic situation and social mobility? Second, who are the actors trying to increase their financial inclusion, what challenges are they facing (excessive regulation, low uptake due to lack of awareness or trust, etc.), and how can those barriers be eased?

The history of job (in)security: Why private law theory may not save work law,"This Article uses a history of the push for job security in the United States during the late 20th century to assess New Private Law (NPL) theory. The history recounts the rise and fall of common law and statutory approaches to replacing at-will employment with termination for just cause only. Applying NPL theory to that history, the Article argues that NPL theorists’ current approach to defining their topic of study and distinguishing it from public law is inconsistent within and across theories. NPL theorists seek to carve out an area of law where interpersonal morality trumps legal economists’ goal of collective welfare maximization. That conceptual project depends on a coherent and consistent approach to distinguishing private from public law. Ultimately, the Article argues, NPL theorists face a more fundamental problem, however. Regardless of how one categorizes the events in this history, it shows that the common law-derived interpersonal morality at the heart of NPL theory may not strengthen worker protections in the ways at least some of its theorists hope.",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/2927
Worker Welfare and Antitrust,"The important field of antitrust and labor has gone through a profound change in orientation. For the great bulk of its history labor has been viewed as a competitive threat, and the debate over antitrust and labor was framed around whether there should be a labor “immunity” from the antitrust laws. In just the last decade, however, the orientation has flipped. Most new writing views labor as a target of anticompetitive restraints imposed by employers. Antitrust is increasingly concerned with protecting labor rather than challenging its conduct.
Antitrust interest in labor markets is properly focused on two things. The smaller concern is the impact of anticompetitive restraints in the labor market, such as no-poaching agreements and noncompete covenants. While antitrust enforcement in this area is critically important, these restraints cover only a portion of the employment market. The bigger labor interest is in output reducing restraints in product markets, and here antitrust policy has unfortunately had little to contribute. The demand for labor is derivative of product market demand. If firms do not produce goods, workers do not work. Because most labor is a variable cost, the demand for employment varies with product output. As a result, when antitrust pursues a goal of higher output in product markets it is incidentally benefitting labor and consumers alike.
Both antitrust’s neoliberal right and its Progressive left have advocated policies that are harmful to labor. The right did so by developing a cynical vision of “consumer welfare” that incorporated producer profits into the definition and advocated for lower output in product markets. The left has done the same thing with its hostility to large firm size, even when dictated by scale economies or network effects, and its protection of small business.",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/2852
Antitrust Interoperability Remedies,"Compelled interoperability can be a useful remedy for dominant firms, including large digital platforms, who violate the antitrust laws. They can address competition concerns without interfering unnecessarily with the structures that make digital platforms attractive and that have contributed so much to economic growth.
Given the wide variety of structures and business models for big tech, “interoperability” must be defined broadly. It can realistically include everything from “dynamic” interoperability that requires real time sharing of data and operations, to “static” interoperability which requires portability but not necessarily real time interactions. Also included are the compelled sharing of intellectual property or other productive assets, or creation of broader and more competitive management of large digital firms.
Designing such remedies requires identification of the particular structures or practices that are making these markets less competitive than they might be. Interoperability is not the best remedy in all situations, nor even for all of those that involve digital platforms.",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/2814
Regulating Machine Learning: The Challenge of Heterogeneity,"Machine learning, or artificial intelligence, refers to a vast array of different algorithms that are being put to highly varied uses, including in transportation, medicine, social media, marketing, and many other settings. Not only do machine-learning algorithms vary widely across their types and uses, but they are evolving constantly. Even the same algorithm can perform quite differently over time as it is fed new data. Due to the staggering heterogeneity of these algorithms, multiple regulatory agencies will be needed to regulate the use of machine learning, each within their own discrete area of specialization. Even these specialized expert agencies, though, will still face the challenge of heterogeneity and must approach their task of regulating machine learning with agility. They must build up their capacity in data sciences, deploy flexible strategies such as management-based regulation, and remain constantly vigilant. Regulators should also consider how they can use machine-learning tools themselves to enhance their ability to protect the public from the adverse effects of machine learning. Effective regulatory governance of machine learning should be possible, but it will depend on the constant pursuit of regulatory excellence.",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/2921

The Antitrust Text,"The antitrust laws are fully stated in two statutes that seem absurdly brief in relation to the work they do. Their brevity in relation to coverage has led to three phenomena. First is the tendency of courts to use the statutory text as no more than a starting point, treating it as a general principle, or “Magna Carta,” of free enterprise, and sometimes ignoring the statutory language altogether. Second, courts have responded to the statutory brevity with judicial development of numerous rules not mentioned in the statutory texts. The third phenomenon is a kind of expansionism, or belief that the antitrust laws can be used to control the entire world, or at least the entire economic world.
This article considers what antitrust policy would look like if an antitrust “textualist” actually relied on the antitrust statutes themselves to control all important issues of interpretation. The language of the antitrust laws, although brief, actually says a great deal more than is commonly acknowledged. Further, the Sherman and Clayton Acts are statutes after all. They should provide the first place to look to for guidance on enforcement policy. How much different would antitrust look if we centered policy on the statutory language, using only generally accepted forensic tools and recognized canons of statutory interpretation to understand it? Among the areas where the statutory language provides considerable direction are the goals of the antitrust laws; market power and market delineation requirements; the probabilistic effects requirement of the Clayton Act, standing and the indirect purchaser rule, conspiratorial capacity and antitrust personhood, and extraterritorial effects.",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/2904
Longer Trips to Court Cause Evictions,"Studying ∼200,000 evictions filed against ∼300,000 Philadelphians from 2005 to 2021, we focus on the role of transit to court in preventing tenants from asserting their rights. In this period, nearly 40% of tenants facing eviction were ordered to leave their residences because they did not show up to contest cases against them and received a default judgment. Controlling for a variety of potential confounds at the tenant and landlord level, we find that residents of private tenancies with longer transit travel time to the courthouse were more likely to default. A 1-h increase in estimated travel time increases the probability of default by between 3.8% and 8.6% points across different model specifications. The effect holds after adjusting for direct distance to the court, unobserved landlord characteristics, and even baseline weekend travel time. However, it is absent in public housing evictions, where timing rules are significantly laxer, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tenants had the opportunity to be present virtually. We estimate that had all tenants been equally able to get to the court in 10 min, there would have been 4,000 to 9,000 fewer default evictions over the sample period. We replicate this commuting effect in another dataset of over 800,000 evictions from Harris County, Texas. These results open up a new way to study the physical determinants of access to justice, illustrating that the location and accessibility of a courthouse can affect individual case outcomes. We suggest that increased use of video technology in court may reduce barriers to justice.",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/2992
Policy Dialogue: Racial Segregation in America's Schools,"America's schools are more segregated today than they were three decades ago. After initial progress in the wake of the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education—further bolstered by the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as by several other rulings by the court—the nation's schools began a process of resegregation in the early 1990s. White resistance, reversals by the court, and growing residential segregation have ensured that many young people attend school with classmates from similar racial and class backgrounds. As a recent report from the UCLA's Civil Rights Project found, the average White student attends a school in which 69 percent of students are White, the average Latinx student attends a school in which 55 percent of students are Latinx, and the average Black student attends a school in which 47 percent of students are Black. Segregation is a fact of life in both the North and the South, in urban and rural communities, in red states and in blue states.
For this Policy Dialogue, HEQ's editors asked Cara McClellan and Matthew Delmont to discuss the segregation of K-12 schools by race. How, we wanted to know, has the past shaped the present and constrained the future? How are present-day efforts responding to that past and challenging the structures and cultures that reinforce racial segregation? What might the future hold? Cara McClellan is director of the Advocacy for Racial and Civil Justice Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School, where she is also an associate professor of practice. Prior to this role, she served as assistant counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, where she represented students and families in cases such as Sheff v. O'Neill. Matthew Delmont is the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor of History at Dartmouth College. His work focuses on African American history and the history of civil rights, and he is the author of several books including Why Busing Failed: Race, Media, and the National Resistance to School Desegregation and, most recently, Half American: The Epic Story of African Americans Fighting World War II at Home and Abroad.
HEQ Policy Dialogues are, by design, intended to promote an informal, free exchange of ideas between scholars.

New Telehealth Services for Underserved Communities,21 teams of MBAs from around the world bring innovative new ideas to a Wharton-sponsored health care competition,https://magazine.wharton.upenn.edu/digital/new-telehealth-services-for-underserved-communities/
The Calculation of Prejudgment Interest,"This Essay describes the proper method of calculating prejudgment interest based on sound financial principles. Using the paradigm that the claim plaintiff holds in litigation represents an involuntary loan from plaintiff to defendant and recognizing that in bankruptcy courts treat legal claims similarly to unsecured debt, we argue that prejudgment interest should be computed using the defendant's unsecured borrowing rate. Furthermore, we argue that courts should use a short-term, floating interest rate rather than a long-term rate in order to provide the proper incentive for the parties to settle. We criticize alternative bases for awarding prejudgment interest and address modifications to account for taxes, insurance, foreign currency conversion, asynchronous payments, and suits involving individual plaintiffs.",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/114

Evading a Race-Conscious Constitution,"The idea of a “colorblind” Constitution is front and center in cases before the Supreme Court this term, including Students for Fair Admissions v. President & Fellows of Harvard College, and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina (UNC). In these cases, the same plaintiff organization, Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), has asked the Supreme Court to rule that the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit universities from considering race as one of many factors in admissions to pursue the educational benefits that flow from diversity. In support of this argument, SFFA invokes the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka to support its colorblind approach. This essay argues that SFFA’s reliance on Brown ignores the role of courts enforcing desegregation in the face of white resistance through the use of racial classifications. Brown and its progeny thus made clear that racial classifications are a necessary remedy for addressing racial discrimination in K-12 public education. Moreover, while SFFA and other conservative plaintiff organizations claim to be opposed to the use of racial classifications—and not the broader goal of pursuing racial diversity and equity in education—these same organizations are simultaneously opposing attempts to pursue diversity and equity through race-neutral means in K-12 education, demonstrating a broader agenda of maintaining the existing racial hierarchy and segregation in schools, while relying on the formal legal principle of colorblindness.",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/2924

Would You Remember Your Court Date?,"“Everyone deserves their day in court”—yet when summoned to court, up to 40 percent of people do not show up. Are these people intentionally skipping court, perhaps lacking fear or care? Recent research suggests that people miss court appearances for a more benign reason: many are unaware of or forget their court dates. Researchers Alissa Fishbane, Aurélie Ouss, and Anuj Shah worked with New York City government offices to develop a program to improve court appearance rates. The program, which involved both redesigned summons forms and texting defendants with reminders, prevented 30,000 arrest warrants for missed court appearances over a recent three-year period. The researchers recommend that instead of increasing punitive measures, such as fines or jail time, for missed court appearances, policymakers should devise behavioral interventions to help defendants better comply with court summons. Compliance depends in part on how well people understand their obligations. Small policy changes could improve how people process information and behave in regulated fields such as health care, natural resource management, tax, and insurance. Opportunities for improvements in compliance may exist for traditional court settings as well. Fishbane, Ouss, and Shah concentrated on criminal summons, which New York City issues for low-level crimes such as disorderly conduct. Police do not usually arrest defendants for such offenses but rather they give defendants a summons form requiring them to go to court two to three months later. Missing this court date subjects defendants to an arrest warrant and the possibility of a $250 fine and about two weeks in jail. But this does not seem to keep approximately 40 percent of defendants from missing their court appearances. Prior to Fishbane, Ouss, and Shah’s study, the summons form was the only notification defendants received stating their court date—and defendants received this single notification during the original incident, months before their court dates. The researchers took a two-pronged approach to improving the summons process, revising both the form itself and texting defendants reminders nearer to their court dates. The previous summons form takes almost the entirety of the first page to describe the defendant, the offense, and the issuing officer before in its bottom two rows providing the court date and address. The previous summons form warns that not following the form’s instructions could lead to an arrest warrant—but provides this warning on the second page. Fishbane, Ouss, and Shah suspect that because of this design, some defendants",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/regreview-synopsis/98
"Human Rights Abuses at 30,000 Feet","Each year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deports more than 200,000 individuals to nearly 200 countries. Forcibly expelling that many people to that many places is no simple undertaking. To carry out this monumental task, ICE has created a complex system consisting of airports and airplanes—and, apparently, rampant human rights abuses. In a paper released last fall, three legal experts shine a light on what they characterize as ICE’s history of human rights violations at the airports and airplanes used for deportation. Immigration advocates have long criticized ICE’s treatment of noncitizens. Much of this criticism has focused on civil and human rights violations within ICE detention facilities. But ICE’s airline network—aptly called ICE Air—operates largely outside of public scrutiny and also can be a venue for abuse. From 2010 to 2018, ICE Air transported nearly 1.73 million people on more than 15,000 flights. ICE Air has managed to fly under the radar primarily because of its sheer complexity and its increasing privatization. In 2010, ICE began outsourcing the complicated task of conducting deportation flights to private charter operators. Most recently, ICE subcontracts to a single broker, which subcontracts with other charter companies, which in turn often hire their own subcontractors. The subcontractors must then contract with other businesses that coordinate logistics and pay airport fees. This layered multi-subcontractor structure has obscured transparency and hinders attempts to learn about ICE Air’s inner workings. In their paper, however, law professor Deborah M. Weissman, lawyer Havan M. Clark, and human rights professor Angelina Snodgrass Godoy charge that many human rights abuses that ICE Air both facilitates and creates occur behind the veil of this privatized “web of operations.” ICE Air officials often “aid and abet” rights violations by executing unlawful deportations, Weissman, Clark, and Godoy allege. This occurs, for instance, when ICE deports noncitizens while their legal proceedings are still pending, violating constitutional due process rights. In one case, ICE deported a mother and daughter on the very morning that they were supposed to appear in court for a hearing to suspend temporarily their removal, according to Weissman, Clark, and Godoy. Outraged, the judge overseeing their case ordered ICE to “turn that plane around … and bring those people back to the United States.” That mother and daughter’s case is not an isolated incident. Between 2011 and 2018, ICE’s own records reveal that ICE Air deported over 8,000 noncitizens with pending proceedings",https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/regreview-synopsis/100

New Model Shows Importance of Local Features in COVID-19 Spread,"As pressures mount in many areas of the U.S. to reopen businesses that were shuttered to prevent COVID-19 spread, a pressing question is, at what level of government should these judgments be made? A new model of disease transmission shows that city- and county-level characteristics have significant impact. Variations in population density and commuter traffic, in temperature over time, and, most important, in how social distancing is actually being practiced, as shown in cell-phone data, were shown to influence how the epidemic is playing out now and may progress in future.",https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/research/studies/local-features-covid-19-spread

Genetics may be essential to understanding these differences, and research on genetic variations that make us susceptible to disease and influence how our bodies handle it has grown over the past two decades.

COVID-19 Mortality: Does the Renin-Angiotensin System Play a Role? | CCEB,"Mortality risk from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to be associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension.

That relationship may provide important clinical insights about how we treat COVID-19, but first we need to clearly understand the causal mechanism that lies at the heart of it—and there, we see conflicting information.",https://www.cceb.med.upenn.edu/research/studies/covid-19-mortality-does-renin-angiotensin-system-play-role

Each graduate program has a separate admissions process. Applicants apply directly to the program of interest. All questions about the admissions process should be directed to the program of interest. Spring 2020 Recognizing the challenges of teaching, learning, and assessing academic performance during the global COVID-19 pandemic, Penn’s admissions committees for graduate and professional programs will take the significant disruptions of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 into account when reviewing students’ transcripts and other admissions materials as part of their regular practice of performing individualized, holistic reviews of each applicant. In particular, as we review applications now and in the future, we will respect decisions regarding the adoption of Pass/Fail and other grading options during the period of COVID-19 disruptions. An applicant will not be adversely affected in the admissions process if their academic institution implemented a mandatory pass/fail (or similar) system for the term or if the applicant chose to participate in an optional pass/fail (or similar) system for the term. Penn’s longstanding commitment remains to admit graduate and professional student cohorts composed of outstanding individuals who demonstrate the resilience and aptitude to succeed in their academic pursuits. Required Tests For PhD applicants: Most, but not all, PhD programs at Penn require the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The University’s institution code is 2926, you only need to send your scores to one Penn code and it will be matched to your application. Each graduate program has a different GRE requirement; please refer to your program of interest for more information. For information about the administration of the GRE, see the Educational Testing Service website. For professional program applicants: Some, but not all, professional programs at Penn require standardized test scores, such as the GRE, LSAT, MCAT, GMAT, etc. Each program has a different requirement and a different institution code. Please refer to your program of interest for more information. International Applicants Applicants who are non-native English speakers may also be required to report scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), Pearson’s PTE Academic, or International English Language Testing System (IELTS).

Resources for Retired Faculty | Office of the Provost| Penn Provost,"Association of Senior, Emeritus, and Retired Faculty The mission of PASEF is to initiate and coordinate activities that encourage retired faculty members to maintain connections among themselves and with the intellectual and social life of the University. Headed by retired faculty, this organization of senior (over 55), retired and emeritus faculty sponsors events that inform, enrich and celebrate the achievements of faculty who have transitioned from full-time university service. PASEF activities include organizing lectures, discussion groups, and social functions to foster fellowship and interaction among members and with the scholarly community on campus; familiarizing members, especially those planning retirement, with issues relating to retirement benefits and retired life; and promoting opportunities for members to render service to the University and its surrounding community. The University provides office space for PASEF on the central campus in the Durhing Wing.   Association for Senior and Emeritus Faculty in PSOM The Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) supports its retired faculty through the Association for Senior and Emeritus Faculty (ASEF).  ASEF serves to enhance the careers of the retired faculty by encouraging them to remain a part of the community of scholars in PSOM.   ASEF serves to support senior faculty by raising awareness of the full range of retirement options available to them. PSOM provides office and meeting space on the PSOM campus, as well an Administrative Assistant.  ASEF members are also members of and are supported by PASEF.     Campus Teaching Opportunities Retired faculty members may arrange to teach courses in the School of Art's and Sciences' College of Liberal and Professional Studies or in their home schools. For example, Professor Frank Goodman, who retired from the University’s Law School faculty in the spring of 2014, returned in the 2014-15 academic year to teach Federal Courts, a subject in which he is a recognized expert and that generations of Penn Law students have enjoyed. Nine emeritus faculty have recently taught undergraduate and masters courses through the College of Liberal and Professional Studies. They include Elijah Anderson, Peter Conn, Stephen Dunning, Stephen Gale, John Kenne, Bryan Roberts, and Jorge Salessi.  Faculty members are encouraged to contact LPS directly for more information about such teaching opportunities. Lifelong Learning at Wharton Some Penn retired faculty are eligible to participate in Wharton’s Lifelong Learning  program. This program serves Wharton and Penn alumni throughout the course of their careers with a variety of learning opportunities on campus, online and worldwide. Retired faculty can seek to be among the consumers of or Wharton faculty and alumni experts featured in forums, webinars, online videos, Executive Education courses, and other events.  For those retired faculty seeking to remain well informed, Wharton Digital Press publications and Knowledge@Wharton are also resources valued by alumni and members of the global business community.  Penn Alumni Travel Penn retired and emeritus faculty and their families are eligible to take trips sponsored by Penn Alumni Travel. Most Alumni tours include a Penn faculty host. Faculty hosts, often experts in a field related to the country visited, provide special lectures and informal discussions during the course of the trip. Retired and emeritus faculty can serve as hosts. For example, Professor Emeritus Roger Allen, former chair of the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations group and President of the Association of Middle East Specialists,  Languages and Civilizations will host a trip to Tunisia, October 1-13, 2015. Retired faculty members are encouraged to contact Emilie LaRosa for details about upcoming hosting opportunities.   Community Engagement Penn's Netter Center for Community Partnerships provides opportunities for retired faculty to become involved in the local community:         Retired Professor Frank Johnston (SAS, Anthropology) has served as the co-chair of the Netter Center Faculty Advisory Board and advises the Center’s Agatson Urban Nutrition Initiative, which emerged from his classes and now has more than a dozen affiliated courses.           Retired Professor Vivian Nachmias (PSOM, Cell and Developmental Biology) worked at Lea Elementary School in life science areas related to her research, including using CCP labs and developing the school garden.          Retired Professor Mike Zuckerman (SAS, History) has been teaching a preceptorial each spring for Netter’s most deeply engaged undergraduate students, using the students' civic engagement activities as the initial prompt for academic, personal and professional reflection and planning.  He is exploring ways that a number of faculty (including emeritus) might be engaged in similar kinds of non-credit bearing, facilitated reflection activities.             Retired Professor Ingrid Waldron (SAS, Biology) provides a monthly professional development series for School District high school biology teachers.  Faculty Reading Group Since 1996, the Deans of Wharton and SAS have funded a Faculty Reading Group. The group meets about seven times a year in an hour-and-a-half  buffet  luncheon seminar setting to discuss important written work. Wharton Professor Daniel Raff facilitates the seminar, and faculty experts normally introduce the discussion.  Each year the seminar explores a theme through articles, original documents, and works of fiction and non-fiction. The objective of the seminar is to engage participants in stimulating cross disciplinary conversations.  Emeritus and other retired faculty are welcome to participate in the Faculty Reading Group and have participated in the past.  For details, contact Prof. Raff at raff@wharton.upenn.edu. Senior Auditing Program The College of Liberal and Professional Studies invites lifelong learners to share in the academic life of the University through a Senior Auditing Program.  The Senior Auditing Program invites retired faculty and other seniors aged 65 and older to enroll in most undergraduate lecture courses in the School of Arts and Sciences. The cost is $500 per semester for each course. With prior permission, retired faculty can also sit in on the classes of faculty colleagues. Class registration takes place online. Senior Auditors may enroll in up to two classes per semester.  ",https://provost.upenn.edu/faculty/retired

I am an international student and cannot return to campus because of US government travel restrictions.  What are my options? Can I request a leave of absence? Other A note about academic integrity , Returning to Campus Will my course be held online or in-person? For the Spring 2021 semester, most undergraduate classes will be taught online, with very few limited exceptions, including courses with clinical experiences and in-person research required for graduation. Graduate and professional students should check with their program or school for the most up to date information about course formats. Format and location information for individual courses is listed in Penn InTouch Course Search (Pennkey login required). What is the schedule for the Spring semester? View the Academic Calendar for the most up to date details.  Classes will begin on Wednesday, January 20, 2021. Spring break has been shortened to Wednesday March 10-Thursday March 11. There are also no classes on: Friday, February 12; Tuesday, March 30; and Monday, April 12. Final exams will conclude on Tuesday, May 11, 2021. Graduate and professional programs may follow a different schedule. Students should check with their program for the most up to date information. I need financial assistance with technology or other emergency funding. The Division of the Vice Provost for University Life's Access and Retention Fund provides one-time Emergency Funds or Opportunity Grants to help low-income and/or first-generation students. Visit here for more details.   Academics Will Spring 2021 courses be pass/fail? The pass/fail policy for undergraduates from the Fall 2020 semester will be extended to the Spring 2021 semester. Undergraduate students will have the option (until the Grade Type Change Deadline on March 19) to take any or all of their courses pass/fail. This option includes courses taken to satisfy major or general education requirements, and the courses will not count against the total number of pass/fail courses allowed in the School. The deadline for changing a grade type will not be extended. Students should  discuss which grading options are best for them with their academic advisor. For Spring 2021, Penn will return to regular grading options for PhD and Research Master’s students. However, acknowledging that substantial challenges may still present themselves for graduate students, there will be a mechanism for individual graduate students to petition to have unlimited pass/fail options should their personal circumstances present the need. The petition process will be available until March 19, the grade type change deadline, and will be handled by the Graduate Dean in each school. The types of petitions that will be considered for approval based on circumstances presented by the pandemic include: Students with additional family responsibilities due to the pandemic Students who are ill or caring for ill family members Students with limited access to internet or necessary technology for remote participation Students unable to participate in required synchronous sessions (due to time zone differences, etc.) Students experiencing housing insecurity Professional students should check with their program regarding grading policies. What happens if I get sick and have to miss class? The usual policies and procedures around absences apply for both in-person and online classes. If you are sick and cannot participate in classes or finish assignments, notify your instructor via email or Canvas as soon as possible. Undergraduate students should use the Course Absence Report system to report absences for both online and in-person classes.  Can I travel for academic or professional purposes? Due to COVID-19, all domestic and international Penn-affiliated travel is currently suspended. Petitions for essential travel will be considered depending on destination risk and your role at the university. This includes travel that is supported by GAPSA and other student governments, graduate groups, academic departments, and schools. To be authorized, any University-related travel will need to be essential and to facilitate work that can be done in no other way. All travel will require pre-approval. Visit Travel Guidelines and Procedures for more information. I have other concerns about my courses. Students should contact their academic advisors and/or school-based advising offices, which remain open. Courses When will my online course be scheduled? Online course content can be provided synchronously (live sessions for the entire class at the same time), asynchronously (recordings or material that can be watched or completed at any time), or by a combination of both methods. If your instructor chooses to provide synchronous online content, it must be offered on the same day(s) and time(s) as your course is regularly scheduled during the semester (in Eastern Time). If you will be participating from a different time zone, please alert your instructor. Format and location information for individual courses is listed in Penn InTouch Course Search (Pennkey login required). The Policy on Secular and Religious Holidays is still in effect. If you have concerns about accommodations for religious observances, please contact your academic advisor or the Chaplain’s Office. Will classes be recorded? Instructors must make sure that all students can engage with course materials, even if they cannot participate synchronously. I need technical support. Penn offers 24/7 Student IT Support for all enrolled students. Student IT Support also has information about PennKey and Two-Step Verification and guides to remote learning tools (Canvas, Panopto, BlueJeans, and Zoom) as well as Student IT Support for each of the University's 12 schools.  Research Will I be able to do undergraduate research in the Spring? For Spring 2021, increased in-person research opportunities are available to undergraduates. For independent studies, work study, and volunteer research experiences, undergraduates will be able to participate in in-person research that cannot be completed remotely, in accordance with University and School Research Resumption Plans available at the Research Resumption: Resource Hub. Under the guidelines for the Quiet Period, no in-person undergraduate research of any kind is permitted until February 1, even if the students are approved by a school’s research resumption plan.   Will I be able to do graduate research in the Spring? Information about current research resumption status and individual school and center plans are available from the Vice Provost for Research at the Research Resumption: Resource Hub. Visiting and Exchange Students Will visiting and exchange students be allowed to participate in Penn programs? There will be no in-person programs for visiting students, exchange students, non-degree students, or students in non-credit programs. Some programs for these students may be offered online; check with your program for more details. Academic Resources and Support How do I access the library or course materials? Penn libraries' digital resources and services as well as librarians are still available. Visit the Libraries’ Virtual Support and Phased Service Availability pages for a full summary of current services and additional information about forthcoming services. I need help learning and studying remotely. The Online Learning Initiative offers Remote Learning: Tips for Students with guidance on developing a study plan, creating space for learning, connecting with other people virtually, and other ideas for how to adapt to remote learning. Weingarten Learning Resources Center also has a list of Resources for Remote Learning and offers virtual individual consultations. I currently have accommodations, or will need them to participate in classes. What should I do? Please contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible. If you are making a first-time accommodations request, complete and follow the instructions on the Self-Identification form online.  The Office of Student Disabilities Services has created an enhanced web portal with extensive resources and information for students and faculty. Graduate and Professional Students How do I submit my dissertation remotely? Penn has instituted special dissertation defense and deposit instructions. Dissertation defenses must be scheduled and presented via remote conferencing. Electronic signatures will be allowed on all required forms for depositing, a printed copy of the dissertation will not be required, and the dissertation must be submitted electronically. Will I receive my PhD stipend in the Spring?   Most fully-funded PhD students will receive their stipend during the spring semester, with a few exceptions for students whose service-related stipends cannot be completed remotely. As part of the President’s PhD Initiative, in the 2020-2021 academic year all currently enrolled PhD students will receive a supplementary stipend of $600 in the Fall semester and $600 in the Spring semester to recognize the additional expenses and research challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. More information is available here.  Where can I get resources as a Teaching Assistant? The Center for Teaching and Learning has a website on remote teaching with extensive resources and strategies for teaching online along with information about using online tools. For TAs who often use chalkboards in teaching, we have created a page with suggestions for teaching recitations or office hours online using virtual whiteboards, as well as information for those running asynchronous discussion boards. The Center for Teaching & Learning continues to run workshops; view the full list of workshops and register here. In addition, Penn Libraries' Virtual Support page provides a range of guides, tutorials, and support services to help with virtual classes. International Students I am an international student and I cannot get a visa to return to the United States for the start of classes.  What are my options?  Can I request a leave of absence? An international student who is enrolled full-time in a degree program is able to take courses online without an F-1 visa if permitted by the institution and subject to certain government exceptions. The University supports this option, so eligible international students who are not able to come to the United States will be able to take online courses provided they are enrolled full-time in a degree program. For more information, visit ISSS. Students who are considering a leave of absence should discuss the best course of option with their academic advisor.  I am an international student and cannot return to campus because of US government travel restrictions.  What are my options?

You should continue to follow the expectations outlined in the Code, and are responsible for asking your instructor for any clarifications. If you have questions about how aspects of the Code of Academic Integrity relate to your classes in this changing landscape, ask your instructor. Remember that the Code states ""If a student is unsure whether his/her action(s) constitute a violation of the Code of Academic Integrity, then it is that student’s responsibility to consult with the instructor to clarify any ambiguities."" Additionally, it is important to educate yourself around the University's copyright policies and how they apply in the online space.

New Grant from Fels Policy Research Initiative Awarded to Continue Addressing Lead and Urban Development | CEET,"Philadelphia has a lead problem. Philadelphia’s old housing stock is what gives it much of its charm yet poses the greatest risk for lead.  92 percent of current Philadelphia housing units were built before 1978, which means that lead continues to be present in the majority of homes in the City, especially in neighborhoods struggling to keep up with maintenance. Research has shown that any interaction between humans and lead is harmful, particularly for children under the age of six. The measurement of lead, the exploration of how children are exposed to it, the subsequent outcomes, and the analysis of how government responds to issues of lead, is interdisciplinary and multi-jurisdictional, covering the natural and medical sciences, governance, and planning.

Look Really Close: Bugs and Environmental Health | CEET,"Benthic macroinvertebrates (macros) are spineless bugs, visible to the naked eye. They are often the nymph and larvae forms of many familiar creatures buzzing and crawling around you every day. You may know them as adult dragonflies, mosquitoes, crane flies, stoneflies and many more. What you may not know, is that these critters can say a lot about the quality of the network of streams they live in, including your source of drinking water.  Unlike fish, macros aren’t as mobile and tend to live within the same area of a waterway for this phase of their lives, clinging onto stones, river banks, leaf packs and anything with an inviting surface. For a macro, it may be nice to call a section of a stream “home,” however with limited mobility; their habitat’s quality is at the mercy of external sources of contamination. Natural waterways may often be forgotten as insignificant reservoirs of life, but ALL life depends on access to clean water – including humans.

STEER researcher Eric Gao studied the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease alongside CEET researcher Dr. Axelsen | CEET,"What is your summer research project?    My summer research project involves quantifying the rate at which amyloid beta proteins aggregate. Amyloid beta proteins form plaques in the brain when they aggregate, which disrupts neural connections and cellular communication. As such, my project involves preparing amyloid beta protein in order to have it fibrilize and observe the rate at which it does so. This is done through the usage of a stain, Thioflavin T, and a fluorescence spectrometer. Thioflavin T specifically binds to amyloid beta fibrils but not the monomer, and when it binds to the fibrils its fluorescence increases dramatically. As such, by observing how the fluorescence increases over the course of the incubation period we can measure how quickly the proteins aggregate. I will also be looking into how HNE, 4-Hydroxynonenal, affects the rate of fibrilization by adding it in various concentrations to the amyloid beta samples.    What are the implications of your",https://ceet.upenn.edu/steer-researcher-eric-gao-studied-the-pathogenesis-of-alzheimers-disease-alongside-ceet-researcher-dr-axelsen/

Good News Regarding Lead Pipe Replacement for Pennsylvania Residents! | CEET,"By Howard Neukrug, December 4, 2018, Professor of Practice, The University of Pennsylvania There are hundreds of thousands of residential lead pipes still in use in Pennsylvania, especially in older neighborhoods where persons of color, seniors or economically disadvantaged citizens often reside. Over time, lead may leach from the pipe surface into the home drinking water supply causing serious health problems, particularly for children. While great strides have been made reducing lead levels from our environment in other areas including leaded gasoline, lead paint, contaminated soils, industrial smokestacks, and water, lead pipes remain a legacy asset, the replacement of which has been largely ignored. Instead, the approach to date has primarily been to educate homeowners about the dangers of the lead pipes and to create financial incentives and assistance to encourage homeowners to replace their lead service lines.

STEER Researcher Dade Ogunmuyiwa studied amyloid beta-40 fibrilization in Thioflavin-T to further understand Alzheimer’s Disease. | CEET,"My name is Dade Ogunmuyiwa and I am a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania. I am double majoring in HSOC and computer and information sciences. This summer I had the opportunity to work in the Axelsen lab as a research fellow.     What was my summer research project?    When Amyloid Beta proteins aggregate in the body, amyloid plaques are formed. These plaques are insoluble and form between nerve cells, thus disrupting the cell communication. Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by amyloid plaques. Omega fatty acids are broken down into HNE during the lipid peroxidation process.    The first goal of my research this summer was to quantify amyloid beta-40 fibrilization in Thioflavin-T. Thioflavin-T is a stain that allows us to look at the fluorescent properties of AB-40.

Over time, lead may leach from the pipe surface into the home drinking water supply causing serious health problems, particularly for children. While great strides have been made reducing lead levels from our environment in other areas including leaded gasoline, lead paint, contaminated soils, industrial smokestacks, and water, lead pipes remain a legacy asset, the replacement of which has been largely ignored. Instead, the approach to date has primarily been to educate homeowners about the dangers of the lead pipes and to create financial incentives and assistance to encourage homeowners to replace their lead service lines. Despite these incentives and assistance, the cost of pipe replacement",https://ceet.upenn.edu/good-news-regarding-lead-pipe-replacement-for-pennsylvania-residents/

STEER Researcher Sophia Zhu analyzes the connection between mental health and wildfire risk & air pollution in California | CEET,"What is your summer research project?   I was drawn to the topic of wildfires because while they are an extremely common and natural occurrence, they have become far more frequent and threatening to both human and animal life in the recent years, with multitudes of research pointing to anthropogenic climate change as the reason behind this. Moreover, while a lot of data has emphasized the effect of wildfires on physical/respiratory health, there is much less on that of wildfires on mental health. Under the mentorship of Dr. Hwang, I used R to investigate the connection between poor mental health days (dependent variable) and several fire indicators, such as percent risk of fire damage, PM2.5, poor AQI days, etc (independent variables). The figure that is attached shows that there is a positive correlation between bad mental health and increased risk of wildfire damage - a relationship that is more prominent when variation due to poverty level as well as education is removed. ",https://ceet.upenn.edu/steer-researcher-sophia-zhu-analyzes-the-connection-between-mental-health-and-wildfire-risk-air-pollution-in-california/

STEER Researcher Bonnie Mendelson uses experimental modeling to understand how climate change can impact disease phenology | CEET,"What is your summer research project?   My summer research project involves creating an experimental model of a multiple-host parasite system in order to study disease phenology or seasonality. A common example of this type of system is the bird-fish system in which a tapeworm parasite infects a three-spined stickleback fish which is then consumed by the belted kingfisher bird. This bird then becomes infected with the parasite and defecates into the water where the fish resides, leaving a growing parasite to once again infect more fish. This system, and many others like it, are strongly dependent on phenology or seasonality. Thus, phenology has the potential to increase or decrease transmission of the parasite depending on the life cycle of the fish and the bird. Changing seasons, which effect migration patterns and temperature for example, can impact how a parasite is transmitted as well as its virulence, effecting the entire host or multiple-host parasite system.&nbsp",https://ceet.upenn.edu/steer-researcher-bonnie-mendelson-uses-experimental-modeling-to-understand-how-climate-change-can-impact-disease-phenology/
What could the New Jersey environmental justice bill mean for Pennsylvania? | CEET,"On September 18th, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed into law a landmark environmental justice bill. This bill, NJ S232, is designed to limit new sources of pollution in environmental justice communities by allowing the Department of Environmental Protection to deny permits for power plants, incinerators, landfills, large recycling facilities and sewage treatment plants if the new permits introduce additional health and environmental risks to already overburdened communities. This is the first state bill to address environmental injustice and cumulative exposures in this way in the country. Environmental injustice refers to the disproportionate placement of sources such as pollution producing industry and landfills leading to greater exposure of low income and minority communities to environmental hazards due to unequal protection through laws, regulations, and enforcement. This injustice has been documented since the 1980s, starting with the work of the United Church of Christ in",https://ceet.upenn.edu/what-could-the-new-jersey-environmental-justice-bill-mean-for-pennsylvania/

(Background: Biliary atresia is a rare gastrointestinal disease in babies where bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder is obstructed. In babies with BA, the extrahepatic bile ducts get damaged in utero and then are obstructed/fibrosed. This prevents the proper flow of bile, so bile builds up in the liver and damages it. This causes liver fibrosis, which eventually leads to liver cirrhosis and liver failure. There are currently no treatments or cure for BA besides a liver transplant, which makes BA the leading indication for pediatric liver transplant. As such, we are",https://ceet.upenn.edu/steer-researcher-cece-chen-investigates-a-toxin-model-for-biliary-atresia-by-conducting-a-preliminary-study-in-electrophile-toxicity-to-cholangiocytes/

Monitor the outdoor air quality for your health! | CEET,"It is finally starting to feel like Spring! With Summer beginning in less than a month, most people are not thinking about air quality! We want to remind you about the importance of air quality to your health. The outdoor air quality is influenced by the combination of pollutants from auto exhaust, power plants, oil refineries and airport emissions. Air pollution can get worse in the summer because sunlight and other pollutants in the air make ozone. Poor air quality is often hard to see and includes invisible pollutants such as ozone and fine particulates. Sensitive groups that may become sick from exposure to ozone and particulates are children, the elderly, people with heart disease or lung problems like asthma. These groups should avoid outdoor activities in the afternoon and early evening on poor air quality days. Thankfully, the air quality where you live is monitored every day!
