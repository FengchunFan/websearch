	Threatened species conservation
	Human development impacts
	Indigenous knowledge and histories


Summer Session II: Marsupials of Australia

Australia is a land of strange and fascinating wildlife. Study abroad in Australia with SFS and spend your summer observing tree-climbing kangaroos, egg-laying mammals, flightless birds, giant lizards, and the many other iconic animals that live in Australia’s ancient rainforests and dry savannas. Learn how each of these species has developed special adaptations to Australia’s unusual habitats and consider the policies and actions needed to preserve these precious ecosystems.

Go spotlighting in the rainforest, hear night wildlife, and observe hopping bandicoots and gliders emerging from trees. Learn about these species’ history of connecting people with the land.

This academically rigorous program follows a six-day/week schedule. The interdisciplinary curriculum is designed to help students actively discover and understand the complexities of environmental, social, and economic issues in Australia. Read more about the SFS program model.

Major academic themes include:

What will my daily life be like? Below are resources to help you answer these questions.

Accessibility 
Penn State Education Abroad works closely with campus resources and our partner institutions around the world to ensure that students of all abilities reach their goal of studying abroad. While we cannot guarantee the accessibility of all program sites and locations, specific accommodations may be arranged on an individual basis. If you have accommodation needs or further questions please consult with the Student Disability Resources office and your Education Abroad Adviser. Additional resources are available through the Penn State Global Website.

Program Specific Accessibility Information
Students requesting physical and health accommodations should contact the SFS Safety and Student Life Department. Students requesting learning accommodations should contact the SFS Office of Academic Affairs. SFS will work with students, home institutions, and physicians to determine the required level of accommodation and whether or not it can be safely and reasonably maintained on program. While SFS strives to make accommodations for most disabilities, due to the remote nature of the programs, there are varying levels of accessibility, services, and accommodations at each SFS center. 

Fieldwork by its very nature is physically arduous: the days are long, the traveling seldom comfortable, and creature comforts generally lacking. The program involves a few fairly strenuous hikes as part of the academic program, so physical conditioning is strongly advised. In order to withstand the pace and rigors of the program as well as any “foreign” health risks of the country, it is strongly advised that you be in good physical health. Due to the humidity and temperatures, SFS has noted that chronic health problems often flare up, even if they are under control in the U.S. You should discuss such conditions seriously with your physician and SFS Admissions or the SFS Safety and Student Life Department to see if this SFS program will be right for you
Gender and LGBTQA
There are dramatic and subtle differences in how gender, identity, sexual expression, and sexual health are perceived in different countries. Before going abroad, it is important that you research the specific country or countries you will be visiting and have a full understanding of their cultural norms. Below are some resources to help you with that research and provide guidance for your life abroad.

Race, Ethnicity, and Faith
When choosing a study abroad location and preparing for your travels, you will want to be mindful of how your experience will be different than what you are used to in the United States. Your racial, ethnic, and spiritual identities may be interacted with and labeled by others differently than what you expect. Here are resources to help you prepare for these differences.


	Multicultural Resource Center
	Religious Diversity Abroad Guide
	Education Abroad Guide for Diversity and Study Abroad


Non-U.S. Citizens
It is possible for non-U.S. Citizens to study abroad through Penn State. To do so successfully, you must plan early because this process may involve obtaining visas and other governmental procedures. Check with your DISSA Adviser prior to committing to a study abroad program and speak with your Education Abroad Adviser for specific information on the host country. If you plan on traveling to other countries during your study abroad experience, you will need to research and make plans to adhere to immigration policies for all of the countries that you plan to travel to and through. You are responsible for applying for visas for all applicable countries on your own. Advisers in the Education Abroad office cannot apply for your visa for you. Additional information may be available through your country's embassy and the consulate for your study abroad country.

Life Abroad



General Information

Disability information will not be used during the admissions process, but rather is meant to provide students with resources to help in planning a successful experience abroad.


Program Specific Accessibility Information
Students requesting physical and health accommodations should contact the SFS Safety and Student Life Department. Students requesting learning accommodations should contact the SFS Office of Academic Affairs. SFS will work with students, home institutions, and physicians to determine the required level of accommodation and whether or not it can be safely and reasonably maintained on program. While SFS strives to make accommodations for most disabilities, due to the remote nature of the programs, there are varying levels of accessibility, services, and accommodations at each SFS center. 

Fieldwork by its very nature is physically arduous: the days are long, the traveling seldom comfortable, and creature comforts generally lacking. The program involves a few fairly strenuous hikes as part of the academic program, so physical conditioning is strongly advised. In order to withstand the pace and rigors of the program as well as any “foreign” health risks of the country, it is strongly advised that you be in good physical health. Due to the humidity and temperatures, SFS has noted that chronic health problems often flare up, even if they are under control in the U.S. You should discuss such conditions seriously with your physician and SFS Admissions or the SFS Safety and Student Life Department to see if this SFS program will be right for you

What will my daily life be like? Below are resources to help you answer these questions.

Accessibility 
Penn State Education Abroad works closely with campus resources and our partner institutions around the world to ensure that students of all abilities reach their goal of studying abroad.

Life Abroad



General Information 
Studying abroad can be one of the most exciting and transformative experiences of your college career. It is an opportunity to develop independence, build cross-cultural competencies, grow as a person, and enhance your academic program. Entering a new culture can be challenging for everyone. You may ask yourself: is this the right country for me? What are their cultural norms? How will my identity be perceived there? What can I do to prepare for this experience? What will my daily life be like? Below are resources to help you answer these questions.

Accessibility 
Penn State Education Abroad works closely with campus resources and our partner institutions around the world to ensure that students of all abilities reach their goal of studying abroad. While we cannot guarantee the accessibility of all program sites and locations, specific accommodations may be arranged on an individual basis. If you have accommodation needs or further questions please consult with the Student Disability Resources office and your Education Abroad Adviser. Additional resources are available through the Penn State Global Website. Disability information will not be used during the admissions process, but rather is meant to provide students with resources to help in planning a successful experience abroad.

Gender and LGBTQA
There are dramatic and subtle differences in how gender, identity, sexual expression, and sexual health are perceived in different countries. Before going abroad, it is important that you research the specific country or countries you will be visiting and have a full understanding of their cultural norms. Below are some resources to help you with that research and provide guidance for your life abroad.

Race, Ethnicity, and Faith
When choosing a study abroad location and preparing for your travels, you will want to be mindful of how your experience will be different than what you are used to in the United States. Your racial, ethnic, and spiritual identities may be interacted with and labeled by others differently than what you expect. Here are resources to help you prepare for these differences.


	Multicultural Resource Center
	Religious Diversity Abroad Guide
	Education Abroad Guide for Diversity and Study Abroad


Non-U.S. Citizens
It is possible for non-U.S. Citizens to study abroad through Penn State. To do so successfully, you must plan early because this process may involve obtaining visas and other governmental procedures. Check with your DISSA Adviser prior to committing to a study abroad program and speak with your Education Abroad Adviser for specific information on the host country. If you plan on traveling to other countries during your study abroad experience, you will need to research and make plans to adhere to immigration policies for all of the countries that you plan to travel to and through. You are responsible for applying for visas for all applicable countries on your own. Advisers in the Education Abroad office cannot apply for your visa for you.

Housing and Meals



Housing
Housing is guaranteed and included in the program. Students will have the option of applying to live on campus in a Residential College or opting for off-campus housing in a student apartment. 

Residential Colleges
The University of Queensland has a thriving residential college environment. If you live in a residential college, you will be part of a unique and active community: residents regularly dine together, participate in hall social events and even compete against other halls in sporting contests. While this is an excellent way to meet Australian students, the application process can be competitive. A limited number of places are available for Arcadia students at Emmanuel College and International House.

International House
As its name suggests, International House aims to facilitate broad and rich educational, social and cross-cultural experiences. This fully-catered housing option houses students in single rooms within larger ""towers"" of 4 or 5 students, which include a shared bathroom. All towers are comprised of male and female students, and International House pays close attention to making sure that each tower is diverse with as many nationalities as possible. Common areas are scattered through International House and social activities are planned throughout the semester, often with a focus on cultural diversity.

Student Apartments
If you prefer a more independent style of housing, Urbanest provides student housing to Brisbane-area university students in self-catered student apartments. Each unit houses five or six students in single bedrooms, each with a private bathroom. You will prepare your own meals in shared kitchen areas within your apartment. A linen package and internet connection will also be provided for you.

Set along the trendy Southbank area of Brisbane, in close proximity to the city center, Urbanst is located along several bus routes and within walking distance of three terminals of City Cat - Brisbane's public ferry service. The commute between Urbanest and UQ by public transportation will take 30-45 minutes.  

Independent housing is not permitted on this program. There will be no exceptions. 

Meals
Meals are not included for students who live in the student apartments. Students who apply and are accepted to live in a residential college will be billed a additional per-semester fee for the additional cost of the housing services and meals which are included.

Housing and Meals



Housing
The University of Melbourne offers study abroad and exchange students a range of accommodation options including residential colleges, student apartments, and shared housing to suit different personalities, budgets and lifestyles. The University of Melbourne provides a service dedicated to assisting students with their housing questions, so you can be confident of help along the way. For more information about housing, visit the University of Melbourne Study Abroad & Exchange Housing website or the University of Melbourne Student Housing website. 

While it is likely that Penn State students who apply for housing early will be offered a room on-campus, on-campus housing at the University of Melbourne is not guaranteed. If students are not offered a room on-campus, the student will be responsible for organizing their own housing in Melbourne. The University of Melbourne will provide resources and advice on how to find housing in Melbourne but it is the responsibility of the student to research their options and secure housing. Students not comfortable with organizing their own housing should consider other program options. 
Meals
Meals are not included in the program and will be organized by the student. 

 


Costs and Funding



Program Costs
Fall Costs 
Spring Costs

The cost of a program is based on Penn State tuition rates and partner institution fees. Due to the variety of locations and partner institutions, costs will vary depending on the program. Education Abroad works closely with our partners to ensure the most accurate cost estimates, however, fees can change quickly and without prior notice. Consult the cost sheets for your chosen program often and if you have any questions please contact your Education Abroad Adviser. 

Scholarships 
The Education Abroad Office awards a number of grants and scholarships to students who participate in an education abroad program through Penn State Global. The application for the scholarships awarded through the Education Abroad Office is included with your program application. Eligibility is based on academic merit and/or financial need. You must have a current FAFSA on file to be awarded. There are additional scholarship opportunities through our partner universities, Penn State Academic Departments, and other sources. To view a full list of scholarships, eligibility requirements, and deadlines visit Funding Study Abroad.

 

Student Aid
Penn State students who plan to study on a Penn State approved program can use most forms of financial aid towards the cost of the program. Exceptions include work-study awards and some athletic scholarships. If you have specific questions regarding your aid awards, contact the Penn State Office of Student Aid. 

Withdrawal & Refund Policy 
Withdrawal and refund details are dependent on the timing and reason for your withdrawal from a Penn State Education Abroad Program. For specific details and steps on how to withdraw, read the Education Abroad Policies. 

After Commitment
Once a student has committed to a Penn State Education Abroad program, they are financially responsible for any fees incurred on their behalf. Therefore, if a student plans to withdraw from a program it is their responsibility to immediately notify the Education Abroad office, in writing; email is preferred. 

Regardless of the timing or reason for the withdrawal, the student will be responsible for paying the Education Abroad Administrative Fees. Additional fees from the partner institution will be assessed according to their withdrawal and refund policies at the date of the withdrawal notice.
After the Start of the Program 
If a student withdraws after the start of a program, any adjustment of Penn State tuition charges will be made according to the Tuition Adjustment Schedule as determined by the Office of the Bursar. Students may be responsible for up to 100% of program costs. In most cases, partial credit cannot be awarded for leaving a program before its successful completion.

For additional information on withdrawal policies, separate and apart from financial consequences, please consult the University Senate Policy on Withdrawal and Leave of Absence.

 


Life Abroad



General Information 
Studying abroad can be one of the most exciting and transformative experiences of your college career. It is an opportunity to develop independence, build cross-cultural competencies, grow as a person, and enhance your academic program. Entering a new culture can be challenging for everyone. You may ask yourself: is this the right country for me? What are their cultural norms? How will my identity be perceived there? What can I do to prepare for this experience? What will my daily life be like? Below are resources to help you answer these questions.

Accessibility 
Penn State Education Abroad works closely with campus resources and our partner institutions around the world to ensure that students of all abilities reach their goal of studying abroad. While we cannot guarantee the accessibility of all program sites and locations, specific accommodations may be arranged on an individual basis. If you have accommodation needs or further questions please consult with the Student Disability Resources office and your Education Abroad Adviser. Additional resources are available through the Penn State Global Website. Disability information will not be used during the admissions process, but rather is meant to provide students with resources to help in planning a successful experience abroad.

Gender and LGBTQA
There are dramatic and subtle differences in how gender, identity, sexual expression, and sexual health are perceived in different countries. Before going abroad, it is important that you research the specific country or countries you will be visiting and have a full understanding of their cultural norms. Below are some resources to help you with that research and provide guidance for your life abroad.


	Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity
	LGBTQA Resources for Study Abroad
	Education Abroad Guide for LGBTQA Travelers
	Education Abroad Guide for Women Travelers


Race, Ethnicity, and Faith
When choosing a study abroad location and preparing for your travels, you will want to be mindful of how your experience will be different than what you are used to in the United States. Your racial, ethnic, and spiritual identities may be interacted with and labeled by others differently than what you expect. Here are resources to help you prepare for these differences.


	Multicultural Resource Center
	Religious Diversity Abroad Guide
	Education Abroad Guide for Diversity and Study Abroad


Non-U.S. Citizens
It is possible for non-U.S. Citizens to study abroad through Penn State. To do so successfully, you must plan early because this process may involve obtaining visas and other governmental procedures. Check with your DISSA Adviser prior to committing to a study abroad program and speak with your Education Abroad Adviser for specific information on the host country. If you plan on traveling to other countries during your study abroad experience, you will need to research and make plans to adhere to immigration policies for all of the countries that you plan to travel to and through. You are responsible for applying for visas for all applicable countries on your own. Advisers in the Education Abroad office cannot apply for your visa for you. Additional information may be available through your country's embassy and the consulate for your study abroad country.

Debunking The Myth that Insurance Coverage is Not Available or Allowed for Intentional Torts or Damages,"Over the years, a myth has developed that insurance coverage is not available or allowed for intentional injuries or damage. This myth has two primary bases: one, the “fortuity” doctrine, which provides that insurance should only cover losses that happen by chance; and two, public policy, which allegedly disfavors allowing insurance for intentional injuries or damage. This article dispels that myth. Many types of liability insurance policies expressly cover intentional torts including trademark infringement, copyright infringement, invasion of privacy, defamation, disparagement, and improper employment practices such as discrimination. In addition, punitive damages, which typically are awarded for intentional misconduct, are covered by insurance policies in most jurisdictions. Further, a public policy analysis actually favors allowing insurance recoveries for intentional injuries or damage. No empirical evidence has been offered to support the argument that the availability of liability insurance increases misconduct by policyholders while the public policy interests of compensating innocent victims and enforcing the terms of contracts are advanced by allowing insurance for intentional injuries or damage.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/178
"Associational Privacy, the Presumption of Innocence, and 'Corruption of Blood' as Constitutional Metaphors in the Debate on 'Familial Searching'","This essay analyzes three constitutional claims about the emerging practice of trawling DNA databases for “near misses” to crime-scene samples that might reflect the fact that the DNA came from a first-degree relative of the nearly matching (but excluded) individual. These claims are that this type of “outer-directed” trawling (which casts suspicion on individual outside the database) is an infringement of constitutionally protected familial privacy, an affront to the presumption of innocence, and an unconstitutional “corruption of blood.” Upon inspection, the relevant constitutional provisions lend no more than metaphorical support to these objections to “familial searching.”",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/70

The comment will begin by giving some background on the general nature of collective security treaties.  It will also describe the events that led up to the signing of the ANZUS Treaty.  In the next section the rules of interpretation applied to treaties will be outlined.  Finally, those rules will be applied to the text included in most collective security agreements, as exemplified by the ANZUS Treaty.  From this application and analysis the extent of a state's power under a collective security agreement with an ally to limit within its own territory the movements of that ally's forces will be determined.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol4/iss1/7

From Isolation to Independence: A Comparison Study of Juvenile Solitary Confinement Practices in the United States and Germany,"The “tough on crime” mentality originating in the 1980’s resulted in a crackdown of juvenile offenders for categorically non-dangerous crimes, leaving many to fend for themselves in high security prisons. An even more harrowing reality, tens of thousands of juvenile offenders in those state and federal prisons today are placed in solitary confinement for week or months on end. Extensive research indicates that solitary confinement has devastating effects on human development, mental soundness, and emotional coping – effects that, unsurprisingly, are much more devastating for juveniles than adults – signaling a desperate need for change. Looking to Germany as a model for improvement, this comment provides a comparison study of juvenile solitary confinement practices in the United States and Germany. First, my research provides an in-depth history of the origin and development of solitary confinement in the United States and Germany. Next, this comment analyzes the current status of juvenile solitary confinement legislation in the United States and Germany, highlighting important legislative efforts. Third, and most importantly, this comment provides an unapologetic account of the disturbing effects of solitary confinement on juveniles. In conclusion, this comment provides recommendations for the future and a call to action for legislative efforts to set up and protect our most vulnerable population",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol8/iss2/10

Is this Belt One Size Fits All? China's Belt and Road Initiative,"Widely considered one of the largest and most ambitious infrastructure projects in human history, China’s Belt and Road Initiative [BRI] has made major headway since its inception in 2013. Although the BRI is formally adopted under the Chinese Communist Party Constitution as an initiative to secure “shared growth through discussion and collaboration,” the BRI is much more than these words convey. This Comment briefly introduces an overview of the BRI, including its components and early research on its effects on participating countries and regions. The Comment then conducts an in-depth analysis of four countries who have participated in the BRI with varying degrees of success. Next, the Comment discusses various international concerns surrounding the BRI, including possible debt diplomacy and military motivations. Finally, the Comment concludes that although the BRI should be applauded for its bold aspirations and developments, it should also be closely monitored by the international community to mitigate any deleterious effects incurred by BRI participants.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol8/iss2/9

"The Role of International Human Rights Law in the Adjudication of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights in Africa","Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, there has been significant progress in the recognition and protection of human rights around the world. The international community has, since 1948, adopted several treaties, which impose obligations on States Parties to make certain that the human and fundamental rights of their citizens are recognized and fully protected. Although human rights are considered the domain of international law, international legal scholars have argued that national governments—that is, the governments of States Parties—must function as the mechanisms for enforcing international human rights law. However, in order for national governments to enforce international human rights law, each country that ratifies an international human rights treaty must incorporate the treaty into its national constitution and hence, create rights that are justiciable in domestic courts. Thus, an African country can, through its constitution, cast away any doubts regarding whether international law, including customary international law, is law within its jurisdiction. This article notes that in African countries whose constitutions do not expressly define a law of reception for international law, it is still possible for domestic courts to employ international law and comparative case law in the interpretation and adjudication of cases involving human rights. After examining cases from several African countries to determine the extent to which domestic courts have utilized international law and comparative law sources in their decisions generally and interpretation of national constitutions in particular, the article then examines two cases from the Constitutional Court of South Africa involving socio-economic rights. It is determined that, even where African States have not yet domesticated international human rights instruments and created rights that are justiciable in domestic courts, progressive judiciaries can still enhance the recognition and protection of human rights by using international law as an interpretive tool in their legal adjudications. Nevertheless, the ultimate goal must remain the domestication of international human rights instruments to create rights that are justiciable in domestic courts.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol8/iss2/8

The Rise of American Conservatism in Israel,"The American fascination with the link between interpretive methodology and political ideology rarely reaches beyond its borders. This Article offers a comparative case study, which converses with the American example—Israel. A twofold argument is offered to facilitate this conversation. First, the Article identifies a shift in the ideological climate of the Supreme Court of Israel, manifested in the rise of a new interpretive method. For the first time, the interpretive theory prevailing in Israel, Purposive Interpretation, faces a viable competitor. The Article unpacks the challenges posed by the new theory, termed Purposive Originalism, in methodology as well as underlying understanding of democratic principles. While Purposive Interpretation is conceptually and historically tied to American liberal theories, Purposive Originalism deeply resonates American conservatism, espousing variations on its three basic tenets: originalism, bright-line rules, and deference. Second, the Article contends that this development should be understood as part of a broader ideological reorientation of the political right-wing in Israel, toward American conservatism. Increasingly drawing on the philosophies and strategies of its American counterpart, the Israeli Right has adopted the compound of social traditionalism, neo-liberal economic policy, and hawkish national security stance, as well as discontent with the administrative state, synthesized under the headline of conservatism. An interpretive methodology that strives for the same values enshrined in this political project fulfills a vital role in its success. Such a convergence of judicial and political reinterpretations of conservatism marks an Israeli recreation of the dynamics that emerged in the U.S. in the 1980s, with an all-encompassing conservative backlash",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol8/iss2/5

Laker Airways: Recognizing the Need for a United States-United Kingdom Antitrust Treaty,"This article analyzes the conflict between the United States and the United Kingdom  regarding the extraterritorial application of American antitrust laws.  It begins by presenting a history of the dispute and then describes how that dispute culminated in a judicial battle in the Laker Airways litigation.
The article recognizes, however, that the question of extraterritorial application of United States antitrust laws is too political in nature to be determined in the judicial arena.  Indeed, recent attempts by United States courts to balance United States and foreign interests have done nothing to assuage Britain's aversion toward American antitrust laws.  This article therefore discusses the need for a bilateral antitrust treaty between the United States and Great Britain and recommends specific provisions to be included in that treaty.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol4/iss1/4
A Proposal to Abolish the U.S. Court of International Trade,"In 1980 Congress enacted the Customs Courts Act of 1980, a law designed to ""improve the Federal judicial machinery by clarifying and revising certain provisions of title 28, United States Code, relating to the judiciary and judicial review of international trade matters.""  Among the revisions enacted was the enlargement of the jurisdiction of the United States Customs Court, renamed the United States Court of International Trade (""CIT"") over most actions involving import transactions into the United States.  Born out of a legislative concern that litigants were bring frustrated in their attempts to obtain judicial review, the Customs Courts Act of 1980 sought to remedy this problem ""by revising the statutes to clarify the present status, jurisdiction and powers of the Customs Court.""
Now that five years have passed since enactment of the Customs Courts Act, it merits a preliminary inquiry whether that Act has achieved its purposes and whether there is any continuing justification for the CIT as a forum for dispute resolution.  This article explores these questions and concludes that the administration of justice would be better served of the Court were abolished.  This article proposes substituting either a system of administrative adjudication with direct appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or, in certain instances, transferring jurisdiction to the federal district courts.  Before discussing this issue, the history of the CIT will be briefly reviewed.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol4/iss1/3

Drawing Lines: Unrelated Probable Cause as a Prerequisite to Early DNA Collection,"Swabbing the inside of a cheek has become part of the custodial arrest process in many jurisdictions. The majority view (thus far) is that routinely collecting DNA before conviction (and analyzing it, recording the results, and comparing them to DNA profiles from crime-scene databases) is consistent with Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, some judges and commentators have argued that DNA sampling in advance of a determination by a judge or grand jury of probable cause for the arrest or charge is unconstitutional. This essay shows that this demand is largely unfounded. Either warrantless, suspicionless DNA collection before conviction is unconstitutional across the board or it is permissible immediately after the arrest. The middle ground of requiring a probable-cause determination for an unrelated offense turns out to be inhospitable.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/50

The Application in United States Courts of the Public Policy Provision of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards,"The purpose of this article is to analyze the some of the cases decided to date about the interpretation of the public policy defense under the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and, in particular, to emphasize the possible confinement of these cases to their facts.  As will be seen, this will lead to the conclusion that while the courts have undoubtedly indicated a narrow construction of the public policy defense, the facts of the cases have hardly presented a real test of how far the courts are prepared to go in enforcing foreign arbitral awards in situations where such enforcement would be in substantial conflict with fundamental domestic legal or moral concepts or with statutes embodying such concepts.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol4/iss2/3
"Camreta and Al-Kidd: The Supreme Court, the Fourth Amendment, and Witnesses","Although few noticed the link between them, two Supreme Court cases decided in the same week last Term, Ashcroft v. al-Kidd and Camreta v. Greene, both involved the Fourth Amendment implications of detaining witnesses to a crime. Al-Kidd, an American citizen, was arrested under the federal material witness statute in connection with an investigation into terrorist activities, and Greene, a nine-year-old suspected victim of child abuse, was seized and interrogated at school by two state officials. The opinions issued in the two cases did little to resolve the constitutional issues that arise in witness detention cases, and in fact muddied the waters by suggesting that the motivations underlying the decision to seize a witness are constitutionally irrelevant. In fact, however, the Fourth Amendment doctrine that governs these cases is the special needs exception, which under Supreme Court precedent does trigger an inquiry into subjective motive. As a result, the Fourth Amendment was violated if al-Kidd was pretextually detained because the FBI wanted an opportunity to investigate him, but lacked the probable cause to arrest him, or if the primary purpose for seizing Greene was to generate evidence in connection with the criminal charges pending against her father.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/172

Gaining Assurances,"This Article explores alternative legal mechanisms for solving a type of coordination problem known as the Assurance Game. The traditional approach has been to focus on changing the expectations of the parties. This Article focuses on altering the underlying payoff structure — not through sanctions, but through risk-reducing mechanisms such as guarantees. One type of risk-reducing mechanism is the conditional money-back guarantee. Conditional money-back guarantees operate in settings ranging from federal deposit insurance to daily deal websites such as Groupon and LivingSocial. In each of these, a promise is made to return an individual’s monetary contribution if an event or condition that depends on the actions of others is met. The condition may be (1) the reaching of a predetermined threshold, or (2) the happening of some event. This Article examines both types of conditional money-back guarantees and analyzes factors that may impact their effectiveness.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/238

Party Autonomy and Consumer Arbitration in Conflict: A “Trojan Horse” in the Access to Justice in the E.U. ADR-Directive 2013/11?,"Arbitration clauses in consumer contracts have been subject to controversy in many jurisdictions; recent U.S. and Canadian Supreme Court case law have been used as examples. European Union (E.U.) law, which originally excluded arbitration in general from the Brussels/Rome regimes, has recently taken a mixed, and to some extent limited, approach by including Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) entities “imposing” a solution in its recent ADR Directive 2013/11. There seems to be an indirect encouragement to develop consumer arbitration schemes in E.U. Member States as a second route to justice. It is too early to evaluate this new and somewhat clandestine policy of the E.U. The paper insists on some additional procedural guarantees should consumer arbitration schemes become more popular among Member countries, even though Dir. 2013/11 already contains some “minimum protection” provisions on “specific acceptance” and applicable law. The basic reference for such additional protection is in Article 47 of the E.U. Charter of Fundamental Rights, viewed together with Article 19(1) para. 2 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) whereby “Member States shall “provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law”. At the time of writing, the implementation measures of Member States concerning Dir. 2013/11 have to be awaited before making any final judgment as to their conformity with E.U. law and efficiency. The paper seeks to provide some guidelines for this coming debate.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol4/iss1/14
"Location, Location, Location: Using Cost of Living to Achieve Tax Equity","All other things being equal, the federal income tax ignores whether the taxpayer lives in a relatively affordable or expensive location. This approach can lead to unfairness; moreover, special deductions for the taxpayer’s actual living expenses, such as home mortgage interest and state and local taxes, do not solve the problem. Tax law scholars have generally been quick to dismiss the equity issues based on assumptions about taxpayer mobility. The existing literature would tax comparable workers equally, regardless of salary and living costs. This approach would unfairly equate differently situated workers. This Article questions the assumption of taxpayer mobility, considers the equity issues associated with failure to index the tax system properly, and assesses potential solutions.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/309
"Lessons and Best Practices for Designers of Fast Track, Low Value, High Volume Global E-Commerce ODR Systems","The momentum behind development of global online fast track low value high volume dispute resolution (hereafter ODR) continues to accelerate. Consumer and business groups around the world are promoting fair, proportionate, effective, online, fast track redress for low value high volume cross border e-commerce disputes. As a result, there will continue to be increasing demand for a variety of effective ODR systems design and procedural rules. Best practices developed by entities like eBay and lessons learned from the work of UNCITRAL Working Group III can be helpful in developing framework models for fast track low value high volume e-commerce ODR systems. E-commerce ODR systems like eBay’s provide a marketplace for e-commerce as well as an electronic system for fast track resolution of disputes which arise on their e-commerce marketplace. Ordinary ODR systems do not provide an e-commerce marketplace but only provide for resolution of disputes. Accordingly, best practices developed by eBay’s e-commerce ODR system discussed in this article are generally applicable and needed by e-commerce ODR systems, but generally inapplicable and not needed by ordinary ODR systems. This article addresses development by eBay of its highly successful fast track low value high volume e-commerce ODR system by application of the following four best practices: (i) Low Value Parameters: Adoption of a generally applicable de facto low value workable monetary “standard” (for example, the Purchase Price “Money Back Guarantee” discussed infra) rather than a “numeric” (i.e. $15,000) monetary description for disputes which are eligible for resolution on the providers’ platforms facilitates global development of fast track low value high volume ODR systems. A $15,000, $10,000 or $5,000 monetary ceiling for low value disputes might constitute low value in a developed economy. It will not in an underdeveloped economy. Hence the need for a low value workable monetary “standard” rather than an unworkable “numeric” monetary description. As indicated, the eBay Purchase Price “Money Back Guarantee” cap on the amount of a permissible claim provides a workable standard in developed and underdeveloped economies. (ii) Limitation of Types of Claims: Leaving resolution of disputes involving high value and complicated legal issues to other forums, eBay’s fast track ODR eligibility requirements also limit the complexity and scope of permissible claims (i.e. claims eligible for resolution on its platform) by giving buyers a “Money Back Guarantee,” which, as noted supra, caps the amount a buyer may claim to recovery of purchase price paid, and also limits",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol4/iss1/13

A Female Disease: The Unintentional Gendering of Fibromyalgia Social Security Claims,"Social Security disability claims are not supposed to be decided based on the gender of the applicant. Reliance on the apparently neutral mechanism of clinical medical evidence, however, has a disproportionate impact on women bringing disability claims based on fibromyalgia. Recognizing and identifying disability has been delegated by Congress and the Social Security Administration almost entirely to physicians, based upon a misguided and mistaken belief that clinical medical evidence evaluated by a trained physician will answer with certainty whether an individual claimant is capable of working. Fibromyalgia, a diffuse syndrome characterized by excess pain that is overwhelmingly diagnosed in women rather than men, is not easily shown with clinical evidence. The disabling aspect of fibromyalgia is widespread and prolonged pain, supported only by a patient’s subjective reports, and even the diagnosis is made on the basis of whether a patient describes pain at specific points on her body. Fibromyalgia claims thus provide a case study for evaluating the effectiveness and objectivity of the disability evaluation process. This article explains why the Social Security Administration relies so heavily on clinical medical evidence, traces the history of excess pain claims and why they are so difficult to evaluate, and explains why the current standards disproportionately disadvantage female fibromyalgia claimants.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/219

Even when defenses to violations of international law are available, this Article will demonstrate that the realities associated with the use of nuclear weapons necessitate the conclusion that any military benefit conferred by such use is inherently disproportionate to the harms caused by any use of nuclear weapons and, therefore, that any use of nuclear weapons is illegal under international law.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol5/iss2/6

The Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law: New Developments and Empirical Evidence,"Beth Farmer contributed the following chapter: ""Competition Policy in China: Trends in Private Civil Litigation""
Effective enforcement of competition laws and regulations benefits society, consumers and market participants, and promotes a competition culture. Private civil actions can contribute to healthy economic development (AML Article 1), consumer welfare, and economic efficiency and more complete and effective enforcement of competition law. This chapter discusses developments in private civil actions under the Chinese AML in the context of recent Provisions of the Supreme People’s Court, national development goals, and the experience of four years of active civil litigation. A spokesperson of the Intellectual Property Tribunal of the Supreme People’s Court reflected on the multifaceted role of competition law as back ground to and in response to questions concerning the new Judicial Interpretation (JI) on matters of antimonopoly jurisdiction, evidence, burdens of proof and other trial practices. By prohibiting anticompetitive activities and protecting competition, the antimonopoly enforcement contributes to the maintenance of market order, he explained. Competition’s goals include protection of consumers and undertakings, promotion of the public interest, enhancing competitiveness and economic security, as well as ‘promoting the healthy development of the socialist market economy’.

Immigrant Rights in the Shadows of Citizenship,"Victor C. Romero is a contributing author: ""Who Should Manage Immigration - Congress or the States?  An Introduction to Constitutional Immigration Law."" Chapter 12, page 286.
Punctuated by marches across the United States in the spring of 2006, immigrant rights has reemerged as a significant and highly visible political issue. Immigrant Rights in the Shadows of U.S. Citizenship brings prominent activists and scholars together to examine the emergence and significance of the contemporary immigrant rights movement. Contributors place the contemporary immigrant rights movement in historical and comparative contexts by looking at the ways immigrants and their allies have staked claims to rights in the past, and by examining movements based in different communities around the United States. Scholars explain the evolution of immigration policy, and analyze current conflicts around issues of immigrant rights; activists engaged in the current movement document the ways in which coalitions have been built among immigrants from different nations, and between immigrant and native born peoples. The essays examine the ways in which questions of immigrant rights engage broader issues of identity, including gender, race, and sexuality.

"Human Trafficking from an International Protection Perspective: Probing the Meaning of Anti-Trafficking Measures for the Protection of Trafficking Victims, with Special Regard to the United Kingdom","The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (ECAT) entered into force in the U.K. on the 1 April 2009. This event led to the belief that Britain's adherence will considerably improve the protection of trafficking victims in the country. In light of such expectations, this study examines which implications anti-trafficking measures may have on the legal protection of trafficking victims, while concentrating on new legal developments in the U.K. The paper analyses first the response of the anti-trafficking framework to international protection needs, and second, considers the scope of an alternative protection regime, namely, of international refugee law. It finally addresses the necessity to view the interaction between both regimes, and assesses how the implementation of the ECAT is likely to affect the right of victims to seek asylum.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol28/iss4/4

When Rights Fall in a Forest . . The Ker-Frisbie Doctrine and American Judicial Countenance of Extraterritorial Abductions and Torture,"This Comment reviews the theories of dismissal which were available to Judge Rafeedie and analyzes the theory he chose. To understand the Judge's reasoning, Part One relates the facts of the abduction of the Mexican National, Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain. Part Two describes the history of the Ker-Frisbie doctrine and its exceptions, and evaluates them in light of the state-action analysis traditionally used in ""domestic"" American constitutional law. Part Three goes on to describe alternative theories, rejected by Judge Rafeedie, which more resolutely denounce international abductions and torture. The Comment observes that Judge Rafeedie's reasoning emphasized U.S. treaty obligations over international law and human rights. The Comment concludes by suggesting that the Ker-Frisbie doctrine has outlived its use and only serves to encourage circumvention of the very laws courts are bound to uphold.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol9/iss2/8

Libel Suits Against American Media in Foreign Courts,"This Comment will first explore the gradual growth of American media into a leading position in foreign markets. English libel law and a current English action, Papandreou v. Time will then be discussed. Next, Canadian libel law and a recent Canadian action, Pindling v. National Broadcasting Company (NBC), will be examined. American libel law will be then described together with two recent suits filed in the United States, Sharon v. Time and Desai v. Hersh. An analysis of how, in each instance, the choice of forum was supported by the plaintiff's goals in filing the suit will lead to the conclusion that both the Papandreou and Pindling suits may have been properly filed in foreign courts, and that it is too early to pinpoint a trend in forum-shopping among libel plaintiffs based solely upon a handful of cases filed in foreign courts against American media defendants.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol9/iss1/7

Hybridization: A Study in Comparative Constitutional Law,"Viewing constitutional law from a global perspective informs us about trends and concurrences that might otherwise go unnoticed. The main focus for this paper is how a new European legal tradition is being forged from two of the most influential Western traditions, the common and civil law. The term hybridization is used to refer to this phenomenon whereby there is convergence between different legal systems. This does not necessarily alter national sovereignty or substitute one system over another. It cannot be measured by success or failure of one legal system over another. It is a common sharing that is best understood through an understanding of the constitutional and legal culture of different countries. In the first instance this hybridization was driven by private law. This has now given way to a European Administrative Law with important constitutional consequences, particularly for the role of courts and institutions. The hybridisation process in the European Union provides an important example for comparative law. The Treaty of Lisbon is the most recent manifestation of how convergence of legal systems in 27 Member States may be achieved while maintaining elements of national and legal sovereignty at the level of the Member State. It holds lessons for the study of constitutional law and its analysis in a global environment. Human rights -similarly may provide an overarching framework that permits hybridization while retaining national societal influences. In that context Japan is a useful case study that similarly shows how adaptation may be accommodated through importing different legal systems while retaining national cultural and societal attitudes. Hybridization requires legal transfers to be studied but equally to recognise the constitutional, legal and cultural consequences of change.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol28/iss3/5

Hereafter, unless otherwise indicated, ""school(s)"" will be used instead of ""faculty(ies)"". I would argue that there is no uniformity among law schools with regard to the purposes for which they educate students. The definition of a school's goals and objectives is influenced by factors peculiar to its own circumstances. Furthermore, the goals of a law school are potentially dynamic. They may change from time to time in response to national and international changes affecting the school in its own local setting, such as a country's political history or economic-development needs.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol29/iss1/3

The Flying Dutchman Dichotomy: The International Right to Leave v. The Sovereign Right to Exclude,"Traditional international law rules that people must be free to move about the world without undue hindrance, coming and going with reasonable freedom. At the same time, the concept of the sovereign nation includes a right to say who will enter the nation's borders, who will be barred. These two principles are at odds with each other: who is to say that because one may travel freely, any given nation must allow that person to enter? It is conceivable that no nation may allow the traveller to enter. There is no law or right which dictates that every traveller must be guaranteed a welcoming destination or even one which is of the person's own choice. This dichotomy, the right to leave versus the right- to exclude, has created a modern class of Dutchmen, presently typified by the Irish. Citizens of the Republic of Ireland are free to leave as they choose, but where may they go? Sovereign nations which traditionally received outflows of Irish immigrants have exercised their right to exclude. -Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States no longer have 'open door' policies for immigrants. England accepts the Irish, but they are barred from citizenship. Driven by economic crisis, these newest Dutchmen are caught in the dichotomy: free to leave, no place to go.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol9/iss2/7

This Comment will begin with an examination of the extradition law of the three states in its traditional form, that is, as recognized before the start in 1969 of the IRA's terrorist campaign. It will continue by discussing the reasons this law was an ineffective tool against the IRA, and how this failure was the impetus for the evolution of extradition law between the three states. The treaties and legislation specifically aimed at combatting terrorism, drafted in response to the failure of traditional extradition law, will then be examined. This Comment will conclude by evaluating the effectiveness of these instruments as used against the IRA.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol9/iss2/5

"<i>Medellin</i>, the President's Foreign Affairs Power and Domestic Law","In this article, Professor Weisburd explores the implications of Medellin v.

He argues that the Court was correct to reject arguments that, on the facts of the case, the President could look to a delegation of authority from Congress or from the Senate as treaty-maker, or that President could treat the matter as resting on his power to settle claims against foreign governments, or that the President's obligation to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed"" would provide the necessary grounding for his action. He also argues that there are reasons to support the Court's result stronger than those that appear in its opinions, and that critics' arguments are not very convincing. Finally, he suggests some implications of the result in Medellin.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol28/iss4/3

Simultaneous Rediffusion by Cable Television Operators in Canada and the Problems of Nonpayment of Copyright Royalties,"This Article surveys a controversial issue involving both Canadian and United States copyright interest groups.  Simultaneous rediffusion involves the unauthorized reception and retransmission or rediffusion of copyrighted United States broadcast programming by foreign cable television systems.  The issue has important ramifications for a future revision of the copyright by the Canadian Parliament as indicated in the Revision of Copyright Subcommittee Report of October 1985 and is useful to an examination of United States copyright principles and the international role of the United States in copyright.
This author's conclusion is that compulsory license for simultaneous rediffusion of broadcast signals is a proper course to take in the development of a long-term copyright policy in Canada.  Economic studies indicate the feasibility of a rediffusion right for copyright owners at a minimal expense to cable television (CATV) systems that may be absorbed as subscription levels climb.  Canadian Satellite Communications (CANCOM) and future superstation development should assure increased viewership for CATV systems to make up for any early revenue declines due to increased royalty payments through any performing rights organizations like Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada (CAPAC).  Whether they be foreign nationals or Canadians, the rights of copyright owners must be balanced against the interest of established industry groups like CATV system owners and the national interest in Canadian cultural development.  By maintaining a rediffusion right, Canadian copyright remains true to copyright principles and law, and does not become solely a means of accomplishing immediate Canadian cultural objectives perhaps feasible through other means.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol5/iss1/2

"Loving v. Virginia in a Post-Racial World: Rethinking Race, Sex, and Marriage","Victor Romero is a contributing author: ""Loving Across the Miles: Binational Same-Sex Marriages"" pages 217-234.
In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional in Loving vs. Virginia. Although this case promotes marital freedom and racial equality, there are still significant legal and social barriers to the free formation of intimate relationships. Marriage continues to be the sole measure of commitment, mixed relationships continue to be rare, and same-sex marriage is only legal in 6 out of 50 states. Most discussion of Loving celebrates the symbolic dismantling of marital discrimination. This book, however, takes a more critical approach to ask how Loving has influenced the “loving” of America. How far have we come since then, and what effect did the case have on individual lives?

Searching for Proportionality in U.S. Administrative Law,"There is no such thing as “proportionality review” in American administrative law, but instead, a number of doctrines that courts deploy to evaluate agency exercises of discretion. In some respects, these frameworks for review resemble proportionality in operation, but there are also notable differences. This essay surveys the doctrines governing judicial review of administrative discretion in the United States, highlighting three distinguishing features of the American approach. First, American judicial review is characterized by a high degree of unpredictability, not only with respect to outcomes, but often with respect to what framework of review is applicable. Second, while classical proportionality review is designed to detect and correct a particular kind of administrative failure — an overreach, in which the government uses measures that are excessive in relation to the ends they are designed to achieve — the American approach is more symmetrical, in that the agency bears the same burden of justification whether it is claimed that its actions go too far or not far enough. Third, reviewing courts in American administrative law tend to “proceduralize” substantive review, focusing more on the agency’s failures to thoroughly ventilate the relevant issues than the merits of the agency’s conclusions, with consequences both for the burdens agencies face before reviewing courts and for the ultimate ability of agencies to realize favored policy options",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/book_contributions/8
Debates on U.S. Immigration,"Shoba S. Wadhia is a contributing author: ""Use of the Term 'Illegal Alien,'"" chapter 33, page 529.
This issues-based reference work (available in both print and electronic formats) shines a spotlight on immigration policy in the United States. The U.S. is a nation of immigrants. Yet while the lofty words enshrined with the Statue of Liberty stand as a source of national pride, the rhetoric and politics surrounding immigration policy all-too-often have proven far less lofty. In reality, the apparently open invitation of Lady Liberty seldom has been without restriction. Throughout our history, impassioned debates about the appropriate scope and nature of such restriction have emerged and mushroomed, among politicians, among scholars of public policy, among the general public. In light of the need to keep students, researchers, and other interested readers informed and up-to-date on status of U.S. immigration policy, this volume uses introductory essays followed by point/counterpoint articles to explore prominent and perennially important debates, providing readers with views on multiple sides of this complex issue. While there are some brief works looking at debates on immigration, as well as some general A-to-Z encyclopedias, we offer more in-depth coverage of a much wider range of themes and issues, thus providing the only fully comprehensive point/counterpoint handbook tackling the issues that political science, history, and sociology majors are asked to explore and to write about as students and that they will grapple with later as policy makers and citizens.

Proportionality Review in Administrative Law,"At the most basic level, the principle of proportionality captures the common-sensical proposition that, when the government acts, the means it chooses should be well-adapted to achieve the ends it is pursuing. The proportionality principle is an admonition, as German administrative law scholar Fritz Fleiner famously wrote many decades ago, that “the police should not shoot at sparrows with cannons”. The use of proportionality review in constitutional and international law has received ample attention from scholars in recent years, but less has been said about proportionality’s role within administrative law. This piece suggest that we can understand the differences in how proportionality is used in the administrative law of different jurisdictions in terms of three principal axes of variation. Systems differ with respect to how extensively proportionality is employed, how intensively review is conducted, and how discursively courts present their analysis. Notwithstanding the substantial cross-national variation in how proportionality is used, there are underlying regularities that lend support to the claim that proportionality amounts to a master concept of public law.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/book_contributions/9
Compassionate Migration and Regional Policy in the Americas,"Victor Romero contributed the chapter ""The Power of Exclusion: Congress, Courts, and the Plenary Power"" pages 21-32.
From the publisher:
This book explores the contested notion of compassionate migration in its discourse and practice. In the context of today's migration patterns within the Americas, compassionate migration can play a fundamental role in responding to the hardships that many migrants suffer before, during, and after their journeys. This volume explores the boundaries of compassion from legal, political, philosophical, and interdisciplinary perspectives, and supplies examples where state and non-state actors engage in practices of compassion and humanity through formal and informal regimes. Despite the lack of a concise and precise definition of the concept and practice of compassionate migration, all authors in this volume agree on the pressing need for more humane and compassionate treatment for those leaving their home country behind in search of a better life.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/book_contributions/10

Intended Parents and the Problem of Perspective,"When asked to identify the legal parents of a child, traditional family law principles look backwards in time, primarily to biology and to marriage. People using assisted reproductive technologies such as surrogacy, however, seek to manifest their intent to become parents with a forward-looking temporal perspective, before a child is conceived and born. Of the existing doctrines used to identify parentage – marital presumption, biology, functional theories, and intent – only intent facilitates a forward-looking perspective. Intent through time, however, is not treated consistently. A woman, for example, may donate an egg, and may place a baby up for adoption, but generally cannot contract into genetic surrogacy, becoming pregnant with her own biological child with the intent of giving the child to intended parents after birth. In such a case, she must renew her intent to give up the child after birth. Intent shown by different groups is also given different weight through time: it is easier for women to opt into parenthood in advance than it is for men. Although the Supreme Court has held that different treatment of unwed mothers and fathers at birth does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the reasons behind differential treatment by gender are not equally applicable through time. This paper argues that the ideal regime of identifying parentage allows entry of pre-birth parentage orders and creates a hierarchy of rules placing intent at the top. This regime would mandate, for example, enforcement of surrogacy agreements even where the surrogate mother bore her own biological child.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/218

"“Foreign Agents,” Sovereignty, and Political Pluralism: How the Russian Foreign Agents Law is Shaping Civil Society","During the 1990s, many Russian non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”) secured foreign funding and participated in transnational advocacy networks. However, in the early 2000s, Russian authorities attempted to regain control over foreign-funded NGOs’ activities, presenting these NGOs as national security threats. The 2012 Russian Foreign Agents Law and the resulting 2018 challenge before the European Court of Human Rights reflect contemporary Russian political rhetoric that views Western governments and their agents, including NGOs, as threats to Russian sovereignty and national security. However, legal challenges also de-politicize the issues by forcing all parties into the framework of legal argument, reflecting the decline of political pluralism in Russia. Revitalizing Russia’s civil and political landscapes requires a thorough redefinition of national security, one that includes NGOs participating in transnational advocacy networks as partners in providing security.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol7/iss2/2
Legalization and Norm Internalization: An Empirical Study of International Human Rights Commitments Eliciting Public Support for Compliance,"Past studies argue that states abide by international human rights laws because the ratification of human rights treaties elicits public demand for compliance. Yet, the extent to which human rights treaties affect public support for compliance is unclear. At times, legalization of norms seems to elicit substantial public support for compliance, but at other times, legalization seems to have little effect. This study incorporates the life cycle of norms to arrive at a deeper understanding of the conditions in which international legal commitments to human rights generate public support for compliance with human rights norms. Using a series of survey experiments, this study finds that the effect of legalization on public support depends on the internalization of the norm itself. When a norm is emerging, legalization garners greater public support. When the norm is internalized, legalization does not always generate greater public support. In a sense, state commitment and norm internalization have substitutable effects on eliciting public support for compliance. This study also uses text analysis to explore the causal mechanisms through which international law causes greater public support for compliance. Laws of high obligation elicit public support by generating concerns over the state’s reputation, regardless of the norm’s life cycle. These findings suggest that policymakers and human rights advocates hoping to elicit greater public support for compliance with human rights norms should invest their political capital and financial resources on legalizing emerging norms.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol7/iss2/1

Lessons From Game Theory About Humanizing Next-Generation Weapons,"This article draws a parallel between nuclear weapons and the next generation of military technology, autonomous systems. It outlines some legal and ethical dilemmas the latter pose, and in particular aspects of the technology that make it dehumanizing. Autonomous systems share all of these attributes with nuclear weapons. This fact should be encouraging, because the dehumanizing effects of nuclear systems have been overcome. Drawing on the evolution of nuclear strategy and the nuclear taboo, I argue that, in negotiating the legal and ethical dilemmas posed by autonomous weapons systems, the role of international law and of normative entrepreneurs will be primarily one of imagination, not regulation. The first and most important task is to create focal points in popular and elite consciousness. To this end, I make three modest suggestions for normative entrepreneurs: to take political incentives seriously, including the impossibility of abolition or non-use; to first establish simple, guiding ideas accessible to a broad population before turning to finer points of law; and to focus on interstate, rather than transnational, cooperation.

Radical Reform of Intercollegiate Athletics: Antitrust and Public Policy Implications,"Universities operating major intercollegiate athletic programs are heading for, if not already in, a crisis.  Corruption continues to affect major football and basketball programs, exacerbated by a failure of imagination and will in identifying and deterring corruption, and by a lack of consensus on what constitutes ""corruption"" when football and men's basketball stars generate millions of dollars but cannot enjoy a lifestyle commensurate with many peer students.  Current levels of spending are nonsustainable at many schools.  Even where intercollegiate athletic programs are sustained primarily by football and basketball revenues, otherwise visionary and questioning college presidents have yet to publicly question why these revenues should subsidize nonrevenue sports at the expense of financially pressed classroom activities.  Contrary to the NCAA Constitution, major football programs do not operate ""in keeping with prudent management and fiscal practices.""  This Essay sets forth an agenda for reform, explains why the agenda reflects sound public policy, and analyzes why and how the NCAA can implement the agenda in a manner consistent with the Sherman Antitrust Act.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/126

"Clarity in the Code du Travail: The Plain Language Movement, French Legislative Drafting, and President Macron’s Collective Bargaining Reform","Although the French Code is known as concise and elegant, the French Labor Code, or the Code du Travail, is not.1 Recent reform to the Code du Travail provides a chance to study Plain Language use in France in 2017. This Comment briefly introduces what Plain Language is, its goal of making the law easier to read, and the international movement to implement Plain Language legal reforms. The Comment then introduces a summary of the French legal system relevant to discussion of the Code du Travail, including how legislation is passed and the structure of a French statute. Next, the Comment discusses the recent labor reform in France, with a brief focus on collective bargaining laws in the context of Plain Language. Eventually, the Comment concludes that changes can still be made to the recent reform to provide more clarity to the reader. Finally, the Comment attempts revisions to two proposed articles within Article 7 of Ordonnance 17-1385 in both French and English.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol7/iss1/23

Precarious Childhood: Law and its (Ir)Relevance in the Digital Lives of Children,"This research provides insight to the way children perceive law and its relevance in the digital realm drawing on in- depth semi-structured interviews with sixty-six eighth- and ninth-grade students from three different Israeli middle schools. According to the findings, children experience the digital world as a precarious environment. Most children interviewed where unaware of or misunderstood relevant legal norms designed to protect web users in general and children in particular. Moreover, children experienced a lack of legal or other appropriate responses to severe incidents of cyberbullying that they experienced firsthand or witnessed as bystanders. Even though children are considered by adults to be digital savvy, as they are spending a growing share of time online and on social media apps, they have almost no awareness of their rights in this sphere. This study provides evidence suggesting that this low-level legal consciousness is responsible for the anxiety and fear articulated by the children we interviewed.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol7/iss1/18
"Game of Thrones: The Qatar Crisis, Forced Expulsions on the Arabian Peninsula","In an extraordinary move, reflecting the Arabian Peninsula’s worst diplomatic dispute in decades, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt have expelled Qatari nationals and imposed an air and sea blockade against Qatar because of its alleged support of terrorist organizations. In June 2018, Qatar filed suit against the UAE at the International Court of Justice, alleging discrimination in violation the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This Article explores the problem of forced expulsion and the utility of formal judicial redress at the level of the ICJ. Borrowing from the frame analysis of Erving Goffman, this clash portrays the dispute in terms of ceremonial performance (dramaturgy) that better suggests its removal to softer, more discursive forums for dispute settlement, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”). Although already described as a major victim of this dispute, the GCC may better preserve the dynamics of purposeful negotiation involving a situation that bears resemblance to a family feud as much as a clash of state interests. This dispute highlights the expanding problem of nationality, migration, and human rights in an age of terror, and the limits but need of informal international legal means to best frame meaningful solutions to an expanding problem. The twentieth century’s experience with the problem of forced migration indicated the need for international legal reforms. The current problem on the Arabian Peninsula signifies clearly that the project to address the issue continues. This Article explores the problem of forced expulsion and the utility of formal judicial redress at the level of the ICJ. After reviewing the history of hospitality and expulsion, this Article factors into the discussion the motivational fear of terrorism and frames the discussion against the backdrops of competing UAE and Qatari claims. The utility of litigating this case before the ICJ is then assessed in terms of substance and dramaturgy, leading to a reconsideration of the value of a soft law solution, perhaps in a way that can reinvigorate the GCC, which has been badly damaged by the dispute.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol7/iss1/17

The Supreme Court's Renewed Focus on Inefficiently Structured Joint Ventures,"Antitrust courts and commentators have long appreciated that joint ventures among rival firms have the potential to provide benefits to consumers and the economy through synergies and economies of scale, but also raise the potential of lessening competition among the venture principals.  The case law and academic literature have often ignored, however, the potential harm that befalls consumers when joint ventures with market power are structured in a manner that gives the principals the ability to direct policy and a strategy in a manner that advances their parochial self-interest, rather than the interests of the venture-as-a-whole.  The Supreme Court's recent decision in American Needle, Inc. v. NFL properly focused on the difference between a single economic entity (like a corporation) and the typical sports league, which is governed by club owners who act in the interests of their own clubs.  It suggests a renewed opportunity for antitrust enforcers to consider the structure of joint ventures that do not face rigorous competition from other providers of similar goods and services, when analyzing antitrust challenges to either specific venture decisions, or to the structure of the venture itself.  In this regard, this essay proposes a workable standard for evaluating joint ventures, focusing on whether decision makers have a fiduciary duty to, and economic incentives aligned with, the profitability of the venture-as-a-whole.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_works/125

Protecting Shareholders from Themselves: How the United Kingdom’s 2011 Takeover Code Amendments Hit their Mark,"Kraft’s takeover of Cadbury in 2011 caused considerable uproar in the United Kingdom. The political outcry caused significant amendments to the United Kingdom’s regulatory framework over mergers and acquisitions, the so-called, Takeover Code. These changes to the Takeover Code were made to help relieve pressure on target companies during takeover situations, and to correct the imbalance of power in favor of bidding companies that the political community had perceived during the Kraft-Cadbury takeover. After the changes were made, but before they were implemented, the business community expressed concern that these added regulations would be detrimental to the M&A market as a whole, and thereby harm shareholders in target companies. This comment attempts to argue that changes are, and will continue to be beneficial and were crafted so as to ensure a similar robustness in the M&A market as the pre-amendment regulatory regime. The comment explores the political climate that led to the amendments, the history of the Takeover Code and the changes themselves. It then argues the amendments will, for the most part, achieve their desired effect without all of the problems envisioned by the critics of the amendments.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol2/iss2/10

The Case of Christmas Island: How International Law Affects the Australian-Malaysian Refugee Deal,"In July 2011, Australia and Malaysia entered into an arrangement in which Australian asylum seekers would be removed to neighboring Malaysia to have their asylum claims processed. Following widespread criticism in the media, Australia’s High Court ruled that such a deal violated Australia’s refuges protection laws. While this ruling should have put an end to the deal, Australia’s Immigration Minister indicated that the agreement might nevertheless be feasible. Policy makers proposed amending Australian domestic immigration laws to allow the deal to go forward unencumbered. A bill to amend Australia’s Migration Act was subsequently introduced. As it currently stands, Australian law and international obligations are in agreement: the Malaysian deal would be improper. However, officials within the Australian government propose disrupting this synchronicity by amending the country’s internal laws. This comment addresses the interplay between Australia’s internal laws and its international obligations and proposes that an amendment to Australia’s Migration Act would not serve as panacea to such a proposed deal. While amending the Migration Act has the effect of overturning the discrete High Court ruling declaring the Malaysian deal improper, Australian courts have intimated that the country’s international obligations branch much further and are not so easily set aside.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol2/iss2/9
How Precipitous a Decline? U.S.-Iranian Relations and the Transition from American Primacy,"This essay is grounded in two basic propositions. The first is that the greatest strategic challenge facing the United States is extricating its foreign policy from a well-worn but deeply counterproductive quest for hegemonic dominance in critical areas of the world, especially the Middle East. The second is that Washington’s handling of its relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran constitutes a crucial test of America’s capacity to put its foreign policy on a more productive and realistic trajectory. Since the Islamic Republic’s founding in 1979, Washington has refused to understand and accept the basic model underlying its political order—the integration of participatory politics and elections with principles and institutions of Islamic governance and a strong commitment to foreign policy independence. Today, however, the United States needs to come to terms with the Islamic Republic—not as a favor to Iran, but to save its own strategic position, in the Middle East and globally. Coming to terms with the Islamic Republic means accepting it as a legitimate political order representing legitimate national interests—and as a rising regional power unwilling to subordinate its foreign policy to American preferences. Accepting a rising regional power as a legitimate entity pursuing its interests in a fundamentally rational and defensive way is how President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger enabled America’s historic opening to the People’s Republic of China in the early 1970s. Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei and the four Iranian presidents elected over the course of Khamenei’s 24-year tenure as the Islamic Republic’s Supreme Leader have all said repeatedly that Tehran is open to better relations with America, but only on the basis of mutual respect, equality, and U.S. acceptance of Iran’s post-revolutionary political order—terms strikingly similar to those that Chinese leaders specified for Sino-American rapprochement. Achieving this kind of comprehensive, “Nixon-to-China” rapprochement with the Islamic Republic of Iran is the biggest strategic challenge facing the United States today.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol2/iss2/7

The Double Helix and the Law of Evidence,"Bridging law, genetics, and statistics, this book is an authoritative history of the long and tortuous process by which DNA science has been integrated into the American legal system.
In a history both scientifically sophisticated and comprehensible to the nonspecialist, David H. Kaye weaves together molecular biology, population genetics, the legal rules of evidence, and theories of statistical reasoning as he describes the struggles between prosecutors and defense counsel over the admissibility of genetic proof of identity. Combining scientific exposition with stories of criminal investigations, scientific and legal hubris, and distortions on all sides, Kaye shows how the adversary system exacerbated divisions among scientists, how lawyers and experts obfuscated some issues and clarified others, how probability and statistics were manipulated and misunderstood, and how the need to convince lay judges influenced the scientific research. Looking to the future, Kaye uses probability theory to clarify legal concepts of relevance and probative value, and describes alternatives to race-based DNA profile frequencies.
Essential reading for lawyers, judges, and expert witnesses in DNA cases, The Double Helix and the Law of Evidence is an informative and provocative contribution to the interdisciplinary study of law and science.

Ethics in International Arbitration,"From the publisher: ""International arbitration is a remarkably resilient institution, but many unresolved and largely unacknowledged ethical quandaries lurk below the surface. Globalization of commercial trade has increased the number and diversity of parties, counsel, experts and arbitrators, which has in turn lead to more frequent ethical conflicts just as procedures have become more formal and transparent. The predictable result is that ethical transgressions are increasingly evident and less tolerable. Despite these developments, regulation of various actors in the system arbitrators, lawyers, experts, third-party funders and arbitral institutions remains ambiguous and often ineffectual.""",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/fac_books/15

"Fans of the World, Unite!: A (Capitalist) Manifesto for Sports Consumers","This book is a clarion call to sports fans. It proposes a significant restructuring of sports leagues. The book sets out a rational program for a revolution that will serve the best interests of the fans and of the sport itself. But the book is not Marxist: it shows how a revolution in the organization of sports might even benefit the owners. By harnassing the power of markets, sports leagues can be made both responsive to the needs of the fans and more efficient. Many years were spent before this book was written evaluating the ways in which leagues work across the globe. Drawing on an extensive study of leagues, the book boils down a plan to two major reforms. Borrowing from NASCAR, the book proposes that team owners should not own sports leagues as well. Rather, league ownership should be separate. The second proposal is drawn from soccer: introduce the competition through a promotion and relegation system. In this type of system, the worst teams in the league are kicked out at the end of the season and replaced by the best-performing teams in the next division down. This gives poor performing teams incentive to step up their game and allows fresh blood to enter the leagues if the poor performers fail to do so.

"Alienated: Immigrant Rights, the Constitution, and Equality in America","Throughout American history, the government has used U.S. citizenship and immigration law to protect privileged groups from less privileged ones, using citizenship as a ""legitimate"" proxy for otherwise invidious, and often unconstitutional, discrimination on the basis of race.  While racial discrimination is rarely legally acceptable today, profiling on the basis of citizenship is still largely unchecked, and has in fact arguable increased in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks on the United States.  In this thoughtful examination of the intersection between American immigration and constitutional law, Victor C. Romero draws our attention to a ""constitutional immigration law paradox"" that reserves certain rights for U.S. citizens only, while simultaneously purporting to treat all people fairly under constitutional law regardless of citizenship.

The Shipping Act of 1984: Bringing the United States in Harmony with International Shipping Practices,"To place the Shipping Act of 1984 in context, this Comment begins by outlining the development of ocean liner conferences and the economics of liner operations.  It then describes the changes in case law that increased foreign carriers' exposure to antitrust liability and caused foreign governments to enact retaliatory blocking statutes in an effort to protect their nationals from the extraterritorial application of United States laws.  The major portion of the Comment then analyzes the Shipping Act of 1984 and compares the provisions that are responsive to international shipping practices with those that remain in conflict with generally accepted shipping policies.  Finally, to illustrate how the Act will operate, the key provisions are applied to a fact situation based on the shipping cases credited with provoking foreign retaliation.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol3/iss2/4
After Tel-Oren: Should Federal Courts Infer a Cause of Action under the Alien Tort Claims Act,"This Comment, consisting of three main parts, examines the cause of action issue that arose in Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic and places it in the context of the Alien Tort Claims Act's (ACTA) prior history.  The first part focuses on the three instances in which a federal court has used the statute to exercise jurisdiction in an alien tort action.  The second part examines the Tel-Oren case, centering on two of the three concurrences forming the District of Columbia Court of Appeals' decision.  The third part suggests that proving a distinct cause of action embodied in the law of nations is not necessary to utilize ATCA.  Rather, a method of statutory construction is proposed that enables courts to infer a right to relief pursuant to ATCA itself.  After examining relevant case law and policy, this Comment concludes that inferring a cause of action under ATCA is desirable.  An analytical framework is then proposed to facilitate judicial attempts to make the necessary inference.",https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/psilr/vol3/iss2/7
