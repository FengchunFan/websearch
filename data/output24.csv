CMU Mission Control - CMU Crowdfunding,"<p>Carnegie Mellon is going to the Moon. The culmination of many years, hundreds of individuals and too many hours to count has brought us to this pivotal moment in history where we will launch two lunar rovers over the next two years. Success will depend on a number of factors, one of which is outfitting a Mission Control Center where mission critical operations will be monitored. With this campaign, we turn to this much needed Mission Control Center, which will be located right here at CMU.</p>",https://crowdfunding.cmu.edu/campaigns/cmu-mission-control
Transportation Energy Resources from Renewable Agriculture (TERRA) - The Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University,We are developing a robotic phenotyping systems for phenotyping crops for rapid breeding decisions. This system positions sensors within the canopy for measurements not observable from above or below. Machine learning and computer vision algorithms are then used to generate phenotyping data from the raw sensor data. – Deployment of mobile system in between plots […],https://www.ri.cmu.edu/project/transportation-energy-resources-from-renewable-agriculture-terra/
